## Classification

- **Problem Type:** proof of ownership verification in deduplicated cloud storage
- **Domain:** Cloud Computing
- **Sub-domain:** Data Deduplication and Security
- **Technique:** Secure Proof of Ownership Scheme
- **Technique Category:** protocol
- **Type:** novel

## Summary

The paper presents a secure and efficient proof of ownership (POW) scheme for deduplicated cloud computing systems, ensuring that only users with the complete file can prove ownership while minimizing I/O, communication, and computational overhead. Engineers should care because this approach addresses significant security vulnerabilities in existing deduplication systems.

## Key Contribution

**A secure and efficient ownership verification scheme that requires the user to possess the complete file to generate ownership proof while minimizing overheads.**

## Problem

The need to securely verify file ownership in deduplicated cloud systems to prevent unauthorized access by malicious users.

## Method

**Approach:** The method involves the server generating a random seed and challenging the user to prove ownership using the entire file and the random values. The user computes a response based on the file blocks and sends it to the server for verification.

**Algorithm:**

1. User sends file tag to server.
2. If file tag exists, server generates a random seed.
3. User computes response using the entire file and the seed.
4. User sends the response to the server.
5. Server computes its own response using the stored file and compares it with the user's response.
6. If responses match, access is granted.

**Input:** File tag (cryptographic fingerprint of the file), complete file.

**Output:** Proof of ownership response (hash value).

**Key Parameters:**

- `seed: random value generated by the server`
- `h: number of bits for the seed`
- `File blocks: segments of the file used in the computation`

**Complexity:** O(n) time for response generation, O(n) space for storing file blocks.

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** Google Firebase cloud services for implementation testing.

**Results:**

- I/O overhead, computational overhead, communication overhead.

**Compared against:** Existing state-of-the-art proof of ownership schemes.

**Improvement:** Significantly lower I/O, computational, and communication overhead compared to existing schemes.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** File blocks, Hash tables for storing file tags

**Dependencies:** Cryptographic libraries for hash functions, Pseudorandom number generators

**Core Operation:**

```python
response = Hash(previous_response || Hash(file_block[i] || PRG(seed || i)))
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure the hash function used is secure and collision-resistant.
- Properly manage the random seed to prevent replay attacks.
- Monitor for potential performance bottlenecks during file block processing.

## Use This When

- Implementing secure cloud storage solutions that require file ownership verification.
- Building systems that need to manage large amounts of redundant data efficiently.
- Developing applications that involve sensitive data sharing in cloud environments.

## Don't Use When

- The application does not require strict ownership verification.
- The system has minimal security concerns regarding data access.
- The overhead of processing is not a critical factor.

## Key Concepts

deduplication, proof of ownership, cloud security, hash functions, pseudorandom generator

## Connects To

- Merkle tree-based proof of ownership schemes
- Bloom filter-based ownership verification
- Secure cloud storage protocols

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of cryptographic hash functions
- Familiarity with cloud storage architectures
- Knowledge of data deduplication techniques

## Limitations

- Requires the complete file for ownership proof generation.
- May incur overhead during initial file uploads.
- Assumes robust user authentication mechanisms are in place.

## Open Questions

- How to further optimize the scheme for large files?
- What additional security measures can be integrated to enhance protection against advanced threats?

## Abstract

When a new file is ingested, the server recognizes its digital fingerprint and says "I already have that one", no need to store another. Your storage quota still gets used, of course, and you still pay for the storage. But behind the scenes, there's only one actual copy of the file, with multiple pointers to it. You can see why this is great for cloud providers. Storage costs stay as low as possible, and bandwidth is lower than it would otherwise be, backup times shrink, and best of all: they get to charge multiple users for something they only actually did for one of them. And in theory, it’s fine for everyone.
