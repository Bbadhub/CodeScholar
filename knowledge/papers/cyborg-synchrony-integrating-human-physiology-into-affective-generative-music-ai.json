    "approach": "The AGM-AI framework consists of two stages: a Foundational Model that learns from diverse physiological responses to music, and Individualized Tuning that adapts the system to each user's unique responses. This allows for real-time generation of music that aligns with users' physiological states.",

      "1. Collect physiological data (EEG, ECG, GSR, motion) while participants listen to music.",

      "3. Train a neural network on synchronized datasets to form the Foundational Model.",
      "4. For Individualized Tuning, collect user-specific biometric responses to the Foundational Model music.",
      "5. Identify outlier responses and adapt the Local Adaptation Layer to refine music generation.",
