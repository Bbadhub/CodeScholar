    "approach": "LViT-Net employs a dual-branch encoder structure to extract local and global features simultaneously. The local branch uses a multi-scale feature fusion module to capture fine-grained details, while the global branch utilizes a Vision Transformer to gather semantic information, which are then fused for robust feature representation.",
    "algorithm_steps": [
      "1. Input pedestrian images into the local and global branches.",
      "2. In the local branch, apply a 4x4 convolution followed by Group Norm to extract local features.",
      "3. Use the Local Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (LMSF) module to combine features at different scales.",
      "4. In the global branch, segment images into patches and process them through a Vision Transformer.",
      "5. Apply the Dual Feature Cross Fusion (DFCF) module to fuse local and global features.",
      "6. Pass the fused features through a linear classifier for identification."
