  "summary": "The authors demonstrate that the knockout of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) impairs melanoma development and alters DNA damage repair in a TG3 mouse model, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for melanoma linked to Parkinson's Disease. Engineers should care because this research provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumor growth and DNA repair pathways that could inform drug development.",
