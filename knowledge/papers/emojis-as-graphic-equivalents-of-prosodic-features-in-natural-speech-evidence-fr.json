  "summary": "The paper investigates how emojis function as graphic representations of prosodic features in natural speech, particularly in computer-mediated communication on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. Engineers should care because understanding this relationship can enhance user interface design and improve text input systems by integrating more intuitive emoji suggestions.",
