  "summary": "This study investigates how cognitive styles (visualizer vs. verbalizer) influence visual attention and comprehension in multimodal museum exhibitions using eye-tracking technology. Engineers should care because the findings provide insights for designing cognitively adaptive exhibition interfaces that enhance visitor engagement and learning outcomes.",
  "key_contribution": "Empirical evidence demonstrating the impact of cognitive style on visual attention patterns and comprehension in museum environments.",
  "problem_type": "cognitive style influence on information processing in multimodal environments",
  "problem_description": "Visitors in museums often engage with complex, multimodal content, and understanding how cognitive styles affect their interaction can improve exhibition design.",
