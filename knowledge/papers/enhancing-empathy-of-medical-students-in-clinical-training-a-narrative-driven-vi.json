  "summary": "This paper presents a narrative-driven virtual reality (VR) experience designed to enhance the empathy of medical students towards patients suffering from undiagnosed chronic pain. The immersive experience allows students to engage with the subjective realities of chronic pain, potentially improving their clinical understanding and patient interactions.",

  "problem_type": "empathy training in medical education",
  "problem_description": "Medical students often lack empathy towards patients with undiagnosed chronic pain, leading to misunderstandings and inadequate care.",
