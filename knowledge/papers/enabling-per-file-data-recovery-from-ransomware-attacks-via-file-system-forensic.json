  "summary": "The paper presents FFRecovery, a novel ransomware defense strategy that enables fine-grained per-file data recovery from ransomware attacks by leveraging file system forensics and flash translation layer data extraction. Engineers should care because it addresses the limitations of existing recovery solutions by allowing users to selectively recover critical files instead of restoring entire disks.",
  "key_contribution": "FFRecovery is the first cross-layer data recovery design against ransomware that collaborates multiple layers of a storage system for file-driven recovery.",
  "problem_type": "data recovery from ransomware attacks",
  "problem_description": "The increasing prevalence of ransomware attacks that encrypt user files necessitates effective recovery solutions that do not require paying ransoms.",

  "method": {
    "approach": "FFRecovery restores corrupted files by first recovering the file system metadata using file system forensics, then extracting the original file data from the flash memory using raw data extraction techniques, and finally assembling the metadata and data to restore the file. It incorporates a garbage collection delay and freeze mechanism to prevent data loss during recovery.",
