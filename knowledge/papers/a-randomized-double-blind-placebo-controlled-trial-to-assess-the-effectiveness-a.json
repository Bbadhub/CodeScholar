  "summary": "This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of three formulations of TruCBN\u2122 (cannabinol) for improving sleep quality compared to a placebo and melatonin. Engineers should care because it provides insights into alternative sleep aids that could inform product development in health and wellness applications.",
  "key_contribution": "Demonstrated that orally ingested CBN is a safe and effective alternative for improving sleep quality compared to placebo and comparable to melatonin.",

    "approach": "The study involved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where participants were assigned to receive one of four softgel formulations (melatonin or varying doses of CBN) or a placebo. Participants reported their sleep quality and other health metrics through online surveys over six weeks.",

      "1. Recruit participants and obtain informed consent.",
      "2. Randomly assign participants to one of five groups: placebo, 4 mg melatonin, 25 mg CBN, 50 mg CBN, or 100 mg CBN.",
      "3. Instruct participants to take one softgel 1-2 hours before bedtime.",
      "4. Collect baseline health outcome assessments using validated measures.",
      "5. Administer weekly online surveys for six weeks to assess sleep quality and side effects.",
      "6. Analyze data using linear mixed-effects regression models."
