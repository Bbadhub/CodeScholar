  "summary": "The paper presents a web-based real-time co-editing system for geospatial features using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), enabling multiple users to edit geospatial data simultaneously without conflicts. Engineers should care because this approach allows for seamless collaboration in dynamic environments like disaster response, where real-time updates are critical.",

    "approach": "The method uses CRDTs to allow users to edit local copies of geospatial data, which are then merged in real-time using a conflict resolution mechanism. The 'tentative operations' technique generates operations based on the most recent session-wide state to minimize concurrency issues.",

      "1. User performs an edit on their local copy of the geospatial data.",

      "4. Transmit the new element to all other sites.",
      "5. Each site integrates the new element into their local data structure based on the originLeft parameter.",
