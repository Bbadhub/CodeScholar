  "summary": "This paper presents a radiographic prediction model that utilizes X-ray images to assess the functional status of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This model is crucial for guiding surgical decisions, particularly between unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), based on whether the ACL is functionally competent.",

    "approach": "The method involves extracting specific radiographic features from X-ray images and using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify significant predictors of ACL function.

      "1. Collect preoperative X-ray images from KOA patients.",
      "2. Extract relevant radiographic features (e.g., wear depth, tibial slope).",

      "4. Use logistic regression to model the relationship between predictors and ACL function.",
      "5. Construct a nomogram to visualize the prediction model.",
