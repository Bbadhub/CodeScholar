  "summary": "The paper presents a novel fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) using triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers (TR-q-ROFNS) to enhance multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) for selecting the best African coffee brand. Engineers should care because this approach allows for more nuanced decision-making in environments where uncertainty and subjective preferences are prevalent.",
