  "summary": "The paper presents the ASPENOPENJETS (AOJs) dataset, which consists of 178 million high pT jets derived from CMS 2016 Open Data, and demonstrates how pre-training the OMNIJET-\u03b1 foundation model on this dataset improves performance in generating boosted top and QCD jets. Engineers should care because this approach leverages transfer learning to enhance model performance on downstream tasks with limited data.",
