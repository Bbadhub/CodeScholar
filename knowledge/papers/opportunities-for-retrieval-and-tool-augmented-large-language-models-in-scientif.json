  "summary": "The paper presents the Context-Aware Language Model for Science (CALMS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist scientists in operating complex scientific instruments and conducting experiments. Engineers should care because CALMS can enhance experimental design and execution, making advanced scientific facilities more accessible and efficient.",

      "1. User inputs a query related to scientific experimentation.",
      "2. The LLM retrieves relevant context from a document store using semantic search.",

      "4. If a tool is required, the LLM generates a tool call based on the user input.",
      "5. The tool executes the command and returns results to the LLM.",
      "6. The LLM formulates a response based on the tool output and context.",
