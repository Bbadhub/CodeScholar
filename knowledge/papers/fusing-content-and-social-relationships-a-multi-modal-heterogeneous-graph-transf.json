  "summary": "The paper presents MM-HGT-Bot, a multi-modal framework for detecting social bots by integrating user-generated content with social relationships through a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer. Engineers should care because it offers a robust method to identify complex bot behaviors that traditional methods struggle to detect.",
