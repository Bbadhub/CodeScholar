  "summary": "The study investigates the anterior midcingulate response to reward in opioid users and demonstrates that this response can be normalized through prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Engineers should care because this approach could lead to new therapeutic interventions for addiction treatment.",
