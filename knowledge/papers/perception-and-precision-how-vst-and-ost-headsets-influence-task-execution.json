  "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of Video See-Through (VST) and Optical See-Through (OST) head-mounted displays (HMDs) on task execution accuracy and efficiency. Engineers should care because understanding these effects can guide the design of more effective AR applications and improve user interaction in various domains.",
