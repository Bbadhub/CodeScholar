  "summary": "This paper compares two multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms, 3D-SORT (a two-stage method) and MOT-DETR (a single-stage method), in the context of greenhouse robotics for tomato harvesting. The findings indicate that while 3D-SORT excels in object detection, MOT-DETR consistently outperforms it in overall tracking accuracy, particularly in complex scenarios with occlusions.",
