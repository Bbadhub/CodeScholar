## Classification

- **Problem Type:** human-robot interaction
- **Domain:** Robotics & Control Systems
- **Sub-domain:** Human-Robot Interaction
- **Technique:** ChatGPT-based Robot Control Platform
- **Technique Category:** framework
- **Type:** novel

## Summary

This paper presents a robot control platform that utilizes ChatGPT to enhance multimodal interactions between humans and the Pepper humanoid robot. Engineers should care because it demonstrates how advanced natural language processing can improve human-robot communication and reduce anxiety in users.

## Key Contribution

**The architecture of a multimodal human-robot interaction control platform based on ChatGPT.**

## Problem

The work is motivated by the need to improve public attitudes towards robots and enhance their performance in human interactions.

## Method

**Approach:** The method integrates ChatGPT with the Pepper robot to facilitate natural conversations. It processes user speech input, converts it to text, interacts with ChatGPT for responses, and outputs the results through speech and visual displays.

**Algorithm:**

1. 1. Capture user speech input using speech recognition.
2. 2. Convert speech to text.
3. 3. Check if the input matches predefined robot actions.
4. 4. If matched, execute the action; if not, send the text to ChatGPT.
5. 5. Receive response from ChatGPT.
6. 6. Display response on Pepper's tablet and convert it to speech.
7. 7. Repeat until the user ends the interaction.

**Input:** User speech input in various languages.

**Output:** Robot actions or responses generated by ChatGPT.

**Key Parameters:**

- `speech_recognition: Google ML Kit`
- `language_support: English, Spanish, Polish, Chinese`
- `response_time: not stated`

**Complexity:** not stated

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** User interaction data collected during experiments.

**Results:**

- Negative Attitude Robot Scale (NARS)
- Robot Anxiety Scale (RAS)

**Compared against:** Previous versions of human-robot interaction systems without ChatGPT.

**Improvement:** Significant improvement in user attitudes and reduction in anxiety after interaction.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** User interaction history, Robot action list, ChatGPT response cache

**Dependencies:** Kotlin, Android Studio, Google ML Kit, MQTT Broker

**Core Operation:**

```python
while user_active: speech_input = get_speech(); response = chatgpt_query(speech_input); execute_action(response);
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure the speech recognition module is correctly configured for the desired languages.
- Be aware of the limitations of the older Android version on Pepper regarding language changes.
- Handle unexpected user inputs gracefully to avoid crashes.

## Use This When

- Building interactive robots for customer service applications.
- Developing educational robots that require natural language interaction.
- Creating robots for therapeutic purposes, especially for anxiety reduction.

## Don't Use When

- Developing robots for highly technical tasks that require precise programming.
- In environments where user interaction is minimal or not required.
- When low-latency responses are critical and cannot be achieved with cloud-based processing.

## Key Concepts

multimodal interaction, natural language processing, robot anxiety, user attitudes, ChatGPT integration

## Connects To

- Natural Language Processing frameworks
- Speech recognition systems
- Robotic control systems
- User experience design in robotics

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of natural language processing concepts.
- Familiarity with robotic control systems.
- Knowledge of Android application development.

## Limitations

- Dependent on cloud processing for ChatGPT interactions, which may introduce latency.
- Limited by the hardware capabilities of the Pepper robot.
- Potential language recognition issues due to older Android version.

## Open Questions

- How can the system be optimized for real-time interactions?
- What additional multimodal inputs can be integrated to enhance user experience?

## Abstract

In 2014 Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, revealed Pepper: A four foot tall humanoid robot that could talk, answer questions, and perform a variety of pre-programmed actions. Pepper had a tablet sticking out of its chest to display visual information to the person it was communicating with. Over the last decade thousands of these little robots were sold around the world and reprogrammed to become everything from front-desk receptionists, to tour guides, to waiters. Most of these installations were experiments: cute demos and a sneak-peak of what might be possible in the future.
