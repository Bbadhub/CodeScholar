  "summary": "This paper presents agentic workflows to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic object-centered planning, addressing the limitations of single-step LLM prompts that struggle with complex queries. Engineers should care because these workflows improve response quality and reliability in robotic applications, particularly in environments requiring nuanced understanding and reasoning.",
