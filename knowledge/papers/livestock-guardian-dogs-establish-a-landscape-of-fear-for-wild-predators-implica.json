  "summary": "This paper demonstrates how livestock guardian dogs create a 'landscape of fear' that influences the foraging behavior of wild predators, thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict and supporting biodiversity. Engineers should care because this understanding can inform the design of wildlife management systems and conservation strategies.",
