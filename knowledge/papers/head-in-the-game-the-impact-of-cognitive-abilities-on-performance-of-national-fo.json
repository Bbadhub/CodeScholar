  "summary": "This study investigates the impact of cognitive abilities, measured by the Athletic Intelligence Quotient (AIQ), on the performance of NFL quarterbacks. Engineers should care because understanding these cognitive metrics can inform the development of predictive models for athlete performance in sports analytics.",
  "key_contribution": "The study demonstrates that cognitive abilities, particularly Reaction Time, significantly predict NFL quarterback performance metrics beyond traditional draft pick evaluations.",
  "problem_type": "predictive modeling for athlete performance",
  "problem_description": "The work is motivated by the need to improve recruitment and performance prediction of NFL quarterbacks using cognitive assessments.",
