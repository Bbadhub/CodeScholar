  "summary": "This paper presents a method for predicting the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) using multinomial logistic regression (MLR) based on financial indicators extracted from prospectuses. Engineers should care because this approach can enhance investment decision-making by providing a more accurate prediction of IPO outcomes.",

    "approach": "The method uses MLR to classify IPO performance into three categories: BELOW AVERAGE, AVERAGE, and ABOVE AVERAGE. It leverages financial ratios and prospectus characteristics as independent variables to predict the class of IPO performance.",

      "1. Collect and preprocess data from prospectuses.",
      "2. Split data into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets.",

      "5. Calculate class probabilities using the trained model.",
      "6. Assign labels based on a predetermined threshold.",
      "7. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score."
