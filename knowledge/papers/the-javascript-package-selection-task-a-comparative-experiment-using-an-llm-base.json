  "summary": "This paper presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that enhances the AIDT recommender system for selecting JavaScript packages. It combines machine learning techniques with large language models (LLMs) to improve the relevance and explainability of package recommendations, addressing the challenges developers face in package selection.",
  "key_contribution": "The introduction of a RAG architecture that integrates LLMs for improved package selection and explanation capabilities.",
  "problem_type": "package selection",
