  "summary": "The paper presents a case study demonstrating the utility of electroanatomic mapping (EAM) as an early diagnostic tool for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). It highlights that EAM can reveal abnormal electrical substrates before structural changes are detected by imaging, which is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.",
