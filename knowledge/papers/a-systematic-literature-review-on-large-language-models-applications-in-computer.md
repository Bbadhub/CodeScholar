large language models, programming education, assessment techniques, literature review

## Connects To

- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Machine Learning in education
- Assessment frameworks in education

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of large language models
- Familiarity with educational assessment methods
- Knowledge of systematic literature review processes

## Limitations

- Focuses primarily on LLMs, may overlook other AI techniques.
- Results may vary based on the quality of reviewed studies.
- Limited to the current state of research as of 2026.

## Open Questions

## Abstract

Today we're diving into a systematic mapping study that examines how LLMs are currently being applied to programming-education assessment. The authors analyzed a few dozen studies across multiple years to understand what's working, what isn't, and where this field is headed. What they found reveals a fundamental shift in how we think about teaching people to code.
