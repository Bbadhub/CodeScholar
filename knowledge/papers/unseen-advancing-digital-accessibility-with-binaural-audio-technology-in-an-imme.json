  "summary": "The paper presents 'Unseen', a prototype game that utilizes binaural audio technology to create an immersive gaming experience for both sighted and visually impaired players. This approach is significant as it addresses the accessibility challenges in 3D gaming environments, allowing visually impaired individuals to engage in gameplay that is typically dominated by visual elements.",
