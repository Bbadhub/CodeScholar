  "summary": "The paper introduces a new error metric called Reflective Error (RE) designed to assess predictive performance specifically at extreme events, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics like RMSE and R-squared. Engineers should care because this metric allows for better evaluation and optimization of models in applications where extreme predictions are critical, such as flood forecasting.",
