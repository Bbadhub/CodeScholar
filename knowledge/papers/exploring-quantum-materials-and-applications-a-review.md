## Abstract

A quantum material is a substance whose behavior cannot be explained by classical physics. Instead, we need quantum mechanics in order to understand their unique properties. What do we mean by classical physics when talking about materials? Materials are governed by particle interaction, for example, the motion of ions in saltwater can be classically explained by electrostatic interactions. But with quantum materials, a quantum mechanics approach is the only way to explain certain characteristics like spin entanglements and high temperature superconductivity. If my explanation of quantum materials feels a little strange or isn’t completely sinking in, then I invite you to enjoy the following quote from Professor of solid-state chemistry, Robert Cava: “I will not endeavour to provide a precise definition of what a quantum material is, but I know one when I see it.” In order to take his advice, and know one when we’ve
