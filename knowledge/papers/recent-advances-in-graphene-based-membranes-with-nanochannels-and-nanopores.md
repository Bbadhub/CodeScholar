## Abstract

Draw 6 dots in the shape of a hexagon, and connect the dots with a line. Now draw the same hexagon next to that hexagon, so that they tessellate (fit together with no gaps between them). Keep growing your hexagons up down and side to side until it resembles a honeycomb lattice, or chicken wire. Congratulations! You’ve drawn graphene. Each dot represents a carbon atom and each line is the covalent bond between them. How do you even make a material that's 1 atom layer thick? The answer is surprisingly simple: scotch tape. Professor Sir Konstantin Novoselov (Kostya) was a PhD student working under Professor Sir Andre Geim at the University of Manchester in 2004 when they made a surprising discovery. Geim encouraged the lab group to spend Friday afternoons playing around with different research ideas. One such idea involved trying to isolate a material that was just 1 atom layer thick. Here’s how they did it: They obtained a lump of
