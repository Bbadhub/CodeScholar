  "summary": "This study demonstrates that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) can significantly reduce persistent post-concussion symptoms in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Engineers should care because this approach offers a practical, safe, and effective intervention that could be integrated into clinical practice for managing TBI-related symptoms.",
  "key_contribution": "Adjunctive nVNS is associated with significant reductions in post-concussive symptom severity across multiple domains in mTBI patients.",
  "problem_type": "symptom management in traumatic brain injury",
  "problem_description": "Persistent cognitive, emotional, and somatic symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) disrupt daily functioning and are often resistant to standard rehabilitative care.",

    "approach": "The method involves using a non-invasive device to stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Patients use the device daily for symptom management, with treatment effects assessed through the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI).",

      "1. Patient completes baseline NSI assessment.",
      "2. Patient is prescribed gammaCore\u2122 device for nVNS.",

      "4. Patient uses the device for 2 minutes, twice in the morning and twice in the evening.",
      "5. Follow-up NSI assessment is conducted approximately 112 days post-treatment initiation.",
      "6. Analyze changes in NSI scores to evaluate treatment efficacy."
