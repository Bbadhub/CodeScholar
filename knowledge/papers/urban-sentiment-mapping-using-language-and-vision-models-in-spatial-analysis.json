  "summary": "The paper presents a two-phase computational framework for urban sentiment mapping that combines language and vision models to analyze public sentiment based on social media data and street view imagery. Engineers should care because this approach provides a scalable and efficient method to understand urban environments and their emotional impacts, which can inform urban planning and design.",
