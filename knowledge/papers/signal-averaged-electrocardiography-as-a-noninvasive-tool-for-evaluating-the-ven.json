  "summary": "The paper demonstrates that Signal Averaged Electrocardiography (SAECG) can effectively predict the ventricular substrate characteristics in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), potentially reducing the need for invasive diagnostic methods. Engineers should care because this non-invasive technique can enhance the assessment of arrhythmia risk and improve patient outcomes.",
