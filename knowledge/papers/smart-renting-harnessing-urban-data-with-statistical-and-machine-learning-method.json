  "summary": "This paper presents a machine learning framework for predicting rental prices in S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil, using urban data. Engineers should care because it provides a practical application of ML techniques to a significant economic sector, enabling better decision-making for tenants and landlords.",
  "key_contribution": "The development of a comprehensive machine learning model that accurately predicts rental prices based on various property attributes.",
  "problem_type": "regression analysis for rental price prediction",
  "problem_description": "The lack of effective tools for estimating rental prices in the Brazilian market, particularly in the context of rising rental demand.",

      "1. Collect rental property data from a real estate website.",
      "2. Preprocess data: clean, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical variables.",
      "3. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.",
      "4. Apply various regression models including Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, and MLP.",
      "5. Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning with k-fold cross-validation.",
      "6. Evaluate models using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2.",
      "7. Select the best model based on performance metrics."
