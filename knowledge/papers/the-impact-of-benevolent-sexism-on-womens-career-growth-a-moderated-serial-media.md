## Summary

This study investigates the impact of benevolent sexism on women's career growth, revealing that it negatively affects self-esteem and increases emotional exhaustion, which in turn hinders career advancement. Engineers should care because the findings highlight the importance of career development strategies in mitigating these adverse effects, providing insights for organizational policy and workplace equality initiatives.

## Key Contribution

**The introduction of a moderated serial mediation model that clarifies how benevolent sexism affects women's career growth through self-esteem and emotional exhaustion.**

## Problem

The real-world problem motivating this work is the persistent gender inequality in career advancement opportunities for women, particularly in male-dominated fields.

## Method

**Approach:** The method employs a three-wave, time-lagged survey to analyze the relationships between benevolent sexism, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and career growth. It utilizes statistical tools to test the moderated serial mediation model.

**Algorithm:**

1. 1. Collect data from female employees across various industries using a three-wave survey.
2. 2. Measure benevolent sexism, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and career growth at different time points.
3. 3. Analyze the data using SPSS and Mplus to test the relationships and mediation effects.
4. 4. Apply bootstrapping techniques to assess the significance of mediation.
5. 5. Evaluate the moderating effects of career development strategies.

**Input:** Data from a three-wave survey including measures of benevolent sexism, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and career growth.

**Output:** Statistical results indicating the relationships between variables and the significance of mediation and moderation effects.

**Key Parameters:**

- `sample_size: 410`
- `significance_level: 0.05`
- `power: 0.80`
- `effect_size: f2 = 0.15`

**Complexity:** not stated

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** Data collected from 410 female employees across various industries in China.

**Results:**

- Career growth, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion measured through survey scales.

**Compared against:** Previous studies on gender discrimination and career development.

**Improvement:** The study provides insights into the negative impact of benevolent sexism, suggesting that career development strategies can mitigate these effects.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** Survey data structure for longitudinal analysis.

**Dependencies:** SPSS 24.0, Mplus 8.3

**Core Operation:**

```python
analyze(data) -> results = mediation_analysis(data, 'benevolent_sexism', 'self_esteem', 'emotional_exhaustion', 'career_growth')
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure diverse sampling to enhance generalizability.
- Be cautious of common method bias; use varied response formats.
- Consider the cultural context when interpreting results.

## Use This When

- You need to analyze the impact of workplace discrimination on employee performance.
- You are developing policies aimed at improving gender equality in the workplace.
- You want to understand the psychological factors affecting career advancement for women.

## Don't Use When

- You are focused solely on technical performance metrics without considering social factors.
- You are working in a male-dominated field where sexism is not perceived as an issue.
- You require immediate quantitative results without the need for mediation analysis.

## Key Concepts

benevolent sexism, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, career growth, career development strategies, Cognitive-Affective Personality System theory

## Connects To

- Ambivalent Sexism Theory
- Cognitive-Affective Personality System theory
- Gender Studies in Workplace Dynamics

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of mediation and moderation analysis.
- Familiarity with survey design and data collection methods.
- Knowledge of gender studies and workplace equality issues.

## Limitations

- Findings may not generalize beyond the Chinese context.
- Self-reported data may introduce bias.
- The study focuses only on female employees, limiting broader applicability.

## Open Questions

- How can organizations effectively implement career development strategies to combat benevolent sexism?
- What are the long-term effects of benevolent sexism on women's career trajectories?

## Abstract

The framework for this study is Cognitive-Affective Personality System theory (CAPS). It posits that one’s personality is comprised of cognitive-affective units, or CAUs, which include how we encode and evaluate ourselves, others, and situations, along with our goals, expectations, beliefs, and emotional states. The key idea is that different situations activate different CAUs, which then influence behavior.
