  "summary": "The Reliever Reliance Test (RRT) is a self-completed behavior-change tool designed to identify and address over-reliance on short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA) among asthma patients. It has shown effectiveness in raising awareness about SABA overuse and encouraging patients to consult healthcare professionals about their asthma treatment.",
  "key_contribution": "The RRT effectively identifies patients at risk of SABA over-reliance and motivates them to seek treatment reviews with healthcare professionals.",
  "problem_type": "behavior change intervention for asthma management",
  "problem_description": "Patients with asthma often over-rely on SABA inhalers, leading to poor asthma control and increased health risks.",

    "approach": "The RRT incorporates the SABA Reliance Questionnaire (SRQ) to assess patients' reliance on SABA and provides personalized feedback and recommendations. It encourages patients to reflect on their beliefs about SABA and prompts them to discuss their treatment with healthcare professionals.",

      "1. Patient completes the RRT online.",
      "2. Calculate the SRQ score based on responses to 5 items.",
      "3. Classify the risk of SABA over-reliance as low, medium, or high based on the SRQ score.",
      "4. Provide personalized feedback and recommendations based on the risk classification.",
      "5. Encourage patients to discuss their treatment with healthcare professionals."
