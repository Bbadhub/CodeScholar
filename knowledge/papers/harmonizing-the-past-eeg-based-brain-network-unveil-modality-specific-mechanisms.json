  "summary": "This research investigates the emotional and neural effects of nostalgia through various sensory channels using EEG measurements. Engineers should care because it provides insights into how different modalities can enhance emotional responses, which can be applied in therapeutic tools and multimedia applications.",
  "key_contribution": "The study demonstrates that audiovisual stimuli elicit stronger nostalgic emotions and neural responses compared to auditory or visual stimuli alone.",

    "approach": "The method involves presenting participants with nostalgic and non-nostalgic stimuli through auditory, visual, and audiovisual channels while recording their EEG. The emotional responses are measured using subjective scales, and the neural activity is analyzed using WPLI to assess brain connectivity.",
