  "summary": "The study investigates the impact of microplastic pollution on the well-being of Baltic herring and bycatch fish species by analyzing their biological tissues and the presence of microplastics. Engineers should care because this research provides insights into environmental monitoring and assessment techniques that can be applied to other ecosystems affected by pollution.",
