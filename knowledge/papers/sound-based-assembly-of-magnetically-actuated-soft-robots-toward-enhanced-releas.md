## Abstract

Magnetic soft robots are one of the most promising tools currently being pursued for biomedicine. They offer wireless control, rapid response, and are often compatible with biological systems. Magnetoresponsive materials can be manipulated remotely and allow for a wide variety of potential movements including bending, stretching, and folding. These kinds of transformations can be completed even in a confined space. This capability makes them perfect for miniaturization. These soft robots could be used for drug delivery, detection and diagnosis, or even for minimally invasive surgery. Numerous methods for manufacturing these robots have been explored thus far. Recent advancements in additive manufacturing (including inkjet-based, extrusion-based, droplet-based, and laser-based) have allowed for the development of agile, multifunction robots. However, these methods are far from perfect. For example, in the extrusion-based technique
