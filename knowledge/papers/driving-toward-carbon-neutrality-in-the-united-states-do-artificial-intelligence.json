  "summary": "This study introduces a novel statistical approach to analyze the dual impact of AI on environmental emissions, revealing that AI can both reduce and increase emissions simultaneously. Engineers should care because this method provides a more nuanced understanding of AI's environmental effects, which can inform better policy and technology design.",
