    "approach": "The protocol involves a source broadcasting packets, a server storing these packets, and clients requesting lost packets via NACK messages. The server responds to these requests by sending repair packets to the clients.",

      "4. The server checks its buffer for the requested packet and sends it back to the client.",
      "5. Clients update their buffers with the received packets and continue broadcasting to receivers."
