  "summary": "The paper introduces Mofka, a persistent event-streaming framework specifically designed for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, addressing the limitations of traditional parallel file systems. Engineers should care because Mofka significantly improves data handling and communication efficiency in complex HPC workflows, achieving up to 8\u00d7 throughput improvement over existing solutions like Kafka and Redpanda.",
  "key_contribution": "Mofka provides a high-performance, modular event-streaming framework tailored for HPC environments, leveraging advanced networking and data handling techniques.",
  "problem_type": "event-streaming for high-performance computing",
  "problem_description": "HPC applications generate vast amounts of data that require efficient management and communication, which traditional file systems struggle to handle effectively.",

      "1. Producer creates a topic with a validator, partition selector, and serializer.",
      "2. Producer batches metadata and sends it to the partition manager.",
      "3. Partition manager redirects metadata to a log provider and RDMA handles for data to a storage provider.",
      "4. Consumer subscribes to partitions and receives metadata batches.",
      "5. Consumer uses a data selector to specify which data parts to retrieve.",
      "6. Data broker transfers the selected data directly to the consumer's memory."
