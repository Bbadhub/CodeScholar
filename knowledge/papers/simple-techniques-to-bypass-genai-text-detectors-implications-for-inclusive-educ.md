## Classification

- **Problem Type:** adversarial detection of AI-generated text
- **Domain:** Machine Learning & AI
- **Sub-domain:** AI text detection
- **Technique:** Adversarial Techniques for GenAI Text Detectors
- **Technique Category:** detection_system
- **Type:** novel

## Summary

This study investigates the effectiveness of six Generative AI (GenAI) text detectors against manipulated AI-generated content to assess their reliability in educational settings. Engineers should care because understanding the limitations of these detectors can inform the development of more robust systems for maintaining academic integrity.

## Key Contribution

**The study reveals significant reductions in the accuracy of GenAI text detectors when faced with simple adversarial techniques, highlighting their unreliability in educational contexts.**

## Problem

The rise of GenAI tools has made it easier for students to produce text that may evade detection by AI text detectors, raising concerns about academic integrity.

## Method

**Approach:** The method involves generating AI text samples using popular GenAI tools and then applying various adversarial techniques to manipulate these samples. The manipulated texts are then tested against multiple GenAI text detectors to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting AI-generated content.

**Algorithm:**

1. Generate initial text samples using GenAI tools (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 2, Bard).
2. Apply adversarial techniques to modify the generated text.
3. Test the modified samples against AI text detectors.
4. Record the detection accuracy of each detector.
5. Analyze the results to assess the impact of adversarial techniques on detection reliability.

**Input:** Text samples generated by GenAI tools, modified using adversarial techniques.

**Output:** Detection accuracy rates of AI text detectors against manipulated text samples.

**Key Parameters:**

- `number_of_samples: 805`
- `number_of_adversarial_techniques: 6`
- `number_of_GenAI_tools: 3`

**Complexity:** not stated

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** 15 original AI-generated text samples, 89 modified samples using adversarial techniques

**Results:**

- detection accuracy: 17.4% reduction in accuracy when faced with adversarial techniques

**Compared against:** Six major GenAI text detectors

**Improvement:** Significant reduction in detection accuracy when adversarial techniques were applied.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** Text samples (original and modified), Detection results storage

**Dependencies:** GenAI tools (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 2, Bard), AI text detection libraries

**Core Operation:**

```python
for sample in generated_samples: modified_sample = apply_adversarial_technique(sample); accuracy = detect_text(modified_sample)
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure the adversarial techniques do not render the text incomprehensible.
- Be aware of the biases in detection tools against non-native speakers.
- Monitor for updates in GenAI tools that may affect detection capabilities.

## Use This When

- Developing systems to detect AI-generated text in educational settings.
- Creating tools to enhance academic integrity in assessments.
- Designing educational policies around the use of GenAI tools.

## Don't Use When

- When high accuracy in detecting AI-generated text is critical.
- In contexts where inclusivity and fairness are paramount.
- When dealing with non-native English speakers to avoid bias.

## Abstract

For as long as there have been classrooms, there have been students in those classrooms figuring out ways to cheat. And as long as students have been cheating, there have been teachers and administrators trying to catch them in the act. Nothing about this cat-and-mouse game is new. What is new however, is the power of the AI tools that students now have available to them. Foundation Models exposed through interfaces like ChatGPT can produce a decent term-paper for a student in seconds, and this has drastically changed the playing field. So what’s a teacher or professor to do? How can they be expected to identify which papers were actually written by their students, and which were copied-and-pasted from a GenAI tool?
