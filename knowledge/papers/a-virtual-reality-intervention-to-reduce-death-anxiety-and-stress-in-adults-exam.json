  "summary": "This paper presents a virtual reality (VR) intervention designed to reduce death anxiety (DA) and stress in adults through a near-death experience (NDE) simulation. Engineers should care because it demonstrates a novel application of VR technology in psychological interventions, potentially offering a scalable solution for mental health challenges.",
