  "summary": "RASCAL v1.0 is an open-source Python tool designed for the reconstruction and extension of climatological time series, particularly in areas with limited observational data. It employs an analog method combined with principal component analysis (PCA) to link large-scale circulation patterns with local atmospheric features, making it valuable for climate research in regions with significant local effects.",
