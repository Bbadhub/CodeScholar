## Summary

This paper presents a narrative-driven virtual reality (VR) experience designed to enhance the empathy of medical students towards patients suffering from undiagnosed chronic pain. The immersive experience allows students to engage with the subjective realities of chronic pain, potentially improving their clinical understanding and patient interactions.

## Key Contribution

**Development of a VR application that effectively enhances empathy in medical training for chronic pain patients.**

## Problem

Medical students often lack empathy towards patients with undiagnosed chronic pain, leading to misunderstandings and inadequate care.

## Method

**Approach:** The method involves immersing medical students in a VR experience that simulates the daily life of a patient with undiagnosed chronic pain. It combines narrative storytelling with sensory stimuli to evoke emotional responses and enhance understanding of the patient's perspective.

**Algorithm:**

1. 1. Initialize VR environment using Unity game engine.
2. 2. Load patient narratives and interactive elements.
3. 3. Present immersive scenes that represent chronic pain experiences.
4. 4. Use gaze control for user interaction with objects.
5. 5. Integrate spatialized audio cues to guide exploration.
6. 6. Collect user feedback through questionnaires post-experience.

**Input:** User's interaction data and VR environment setup.

**Output:** User feedback on empathy and understanding of chronic pain.

**Key Parameters:**

- `VR headset: Samsung Odyssey`
- `Development PC: Intel Core i7-8809G, Radeon RX Vega M GC`
- `Duration of experience: 4 minutes`

**Complexity:** Not stated

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** User feedback from 70 medical students

**Results:**

- SUS score: 70.13 ± 7.38
- Empathy ratings: VR-experienced group scored higher than VR-inexperienced group on multiple questions

**Compared against:** Traditional medical education methods

**Improvement:** Significant improvements in empathy and understanding of chronic pain compared to traditional methods.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** 3D models of environments, Patient narrative scripts, User interaction logs

**Dependencies:** Unity game engine, VR hardware (Samsung Odyssey), SPSS for data analysis

**Core Operation:**

```python
initialize_VR_experience(); load_patient_narratives(); present_scenes(); collect_user_feedback();
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure VR hardware is properly configured.
- Test for user comfort during the experience.
- Collect qualitative feedback for future improvements.

## Use This When

- Training medical students on patient empathy.
- Developing immersive educational tools for healthcare.
- Addressing the challenges of undiagnosed chronic pain in clinical settings.

## Don't Use When

- When traditional teaching methods are sufficient.
- For training in non-empathetic skills.
- In environments lacking VR technology.

## Key Concepts

Virtual Reality, Empathy Training, Chronic Pain, Narrative Learning

## Connects To

- Empathy training frameworks
- Other VR educational tools
- Chronic pain management strategies

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of VR technology
- Knowledge of chronic pain conditions
- Familiarity with empathy training techniques

## Limitations

- Limited to users with access to VR technology.
- May not fully represent all patient experiences.
- Requires careful design to avoid discomfort in users.

## Open Questions

- How can the VR experience be adapted for other medical conditions?
- What long-term effects does VR empathy training have on clinical practice?

## Abstract

Imagine that you've got a sharp pain in your lower back. It hurts when you sit, when you stand, when you walk, and when you do nothing. It’s just… hurting… all the time. But when you go to the doctor, you get a clean bill of health. There’s nothing on your x-ray, or your MRI. There’s nothing abnormal in your bloodwork, or your neurological exam. So from the doctors’ perspective, there’s nothing to treat. They send you on your way.
