  "summary": "This paper presents an evolutionary game theory model to analyze the strategic dynamics between Japan, other countries, and the Japan Fisheries Association regarding the discharge of Fukushima's nuclear wastewater. Engineers should care because this model provides insights into stakeholder interactions and decision-making processes that can inform policy and management strategies in environmental crises.",
