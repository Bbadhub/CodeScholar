  "summary": "The paper presents a passwordless authentication system called Sesame Auth, which integrates cryptography, steganography, and biometrics to enhance security while maintaining user-friendliness. Engineers should care because it offers a scalable alternative to traditional password-based systems, eliminating the need for shared secrets and reducing the risk of breaches.",

    "approach": "Sesame Auth eliminates the need for passwords by using a combination of cryptographic keys, steganography to embed credentials in images, and biometric authentication. The system captures user typing patterns for account recovery and uses secure communication protocols to ensure data integrity.",
    "algorithm_steps": [
      "1. User installs the Sesame Auth app and registers by providing a username.",
      "2. The app captures the user's typing pattern for account recovery.",
      "3. User uploads an image that will store their account credentials using steganography.",
      "4. The app generates cryptographic keys and securely stores them on the device.",
      "5. During authentication, the user enters their username and receives a random string for verification.",
      "6. The user enters the random string in the app and completes biometric authentication.",
      "7. The server verifies the input and grants access if it matches."
