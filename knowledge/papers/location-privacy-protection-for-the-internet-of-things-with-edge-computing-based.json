  "summary": "The paper presents a novel Clustering K-anonymity Algorithm (CKA) designed to enhance location privacy protection for IoT devices utilizing edge computing. This approach is significant for engineers as it addresses vulnerabilities in traditional K-anonymity methods, particularly against narrow-region attacks, by effectively obscuring user locations through clustering and the use of virtual nodes.",
