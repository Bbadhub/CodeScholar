  "summary": "The paper proposes the establishment of national Fisheries Restricted Areas (nFRAs) as a tool for sustainable management of vulnerable fish populations in the Black Sea. This approach aims to enhance biodiversity conservation and improve local fisheries management by protecting critical habitats and reducing fishing pressure in specific areas.",
