  "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of first-person avatar customization on the sense of embodiment in immersive virtual reality (VR) and its potential to reduce implicit biases towards larger-sized individuals. Engineers should care because the findings suggest that first-person customization can enhance user experience and promote social change through VR applications.",

    "approach": "Participants customize their avatars from a first-person perspective by grabbing and pulling their avatar to resize it, as opposed to using sliders in a third-person perspective. This method is hypothesized to increase the sense of embodiment and reduce biases.",

      "1. User dons VR headset and controllers.",
      "2. User selects avatar customization mode (first-person or third-person).",

      "4. In third-person mode, user adjusts sliders to modify avatar size.",
      "5. User engages in a game to enhance embodiment.",
      "6. User completes questionnaires to assess embodiment and implicit bias."

    "input": "User's interactions with the avatar (grabbing and pulling or slider adjustments), and the avatar's blend shape parameters.",
