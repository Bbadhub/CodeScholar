  "summary": "This paper analyzes the impact of Comprehensive Health Insurance (CHI) on mortality rates in children under one year in Peru, utilizing data from the Demographic and Health Survey from 2010 to 2022. Engineers should care because understanding the effects of health insurance on child mortality can inform the design of health systems and policies aimed at improving health outcomes.",
