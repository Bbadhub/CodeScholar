  "summary": "This study investigates the relationship between digital hoarding and cognitive failures among Chinese college students, revealing that digital hoarding leads to increased cognitive failures mediated by fatigue and moderated by mindfulness. Engineers should care because understanding these relationships can inform the design of digital tools that help users manage their digital content more effectively.",
  "key_contribution": "The study empirically confirms the mediating role of fatigue and the moderating role of mindfulness in the relationship between digital hoarding and cognitive failures.",
