  "summary": "The paper conducts a comprehensive life-cycle assessment of a newly developed neighborhood in Copenhagen, quantifying embodied CO2 equivalent emissions from buildings, infrastructure, landscape, and major earthworks. Engineers should care because it provides a framework for assessing the environmental impact of urban development, which is increasingly critical in sustainable design.",
