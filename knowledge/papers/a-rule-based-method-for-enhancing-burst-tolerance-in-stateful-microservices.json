  "summary": "The paper presents a rule-based method to enhance burst tolerance in stateful microservices by combining write-scaling and load balancing to distribute workloads across multiple nodes. Engineers should care because this approach reduces failure rates and extends operational time under burst conditions, thereby preserving application availability.",
