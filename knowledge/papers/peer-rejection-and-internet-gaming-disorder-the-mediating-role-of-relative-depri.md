## Summary

This study investigates the relationship between peer rejection and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), highlighting the mediating role of relative deprivation and the moderating role of grit. Engineers should care because understanding these psychological mechanisms can inform the development of intervention programs aimed at reducing IGD among youth.

## Key Contribution

**Identifying relative deprivation as a mediating factor and grit as a moderating factor in the relationship between peer rejection and Internet Gaming Disorder.**

## Problem

The rise of Internet Gaming Disorder among minors, exacerbated by peer rejection and social factors.

## Method

**Approach:** The method involves a longitudinal study with three measurement points to assess the relationships between peer rejection, relative deprivation, grit, and Internet Gaming Disorder. Statistical analyses using PROCESS for SPSS are employed to test the moderated mediation model.

**Algorithm:**

1. 1. Collect data from participants at three time points.
2. 2. Measure peer rejection, relative deprivation, grit, and IGD using validated scales.
3. 3. Use PROCESS for SPSS to analyze the data.
4. 4. Test for mediation of relative deprivation between peer rejection and IGD.
5. 5. Test for moderation of grit on the relationship between relative deprivation and IGD.
6. 6. Interpret the results to understand the relationships.

**Input:** Questionnaire responses measuring peer rejection, relative deprivation, grit, and Internet Gaming Disorder.

**Output:** Statistical results indicating the relationships and effects among the variables.

**Key Parameters:**

- `Sample size: 1,065 students`
- `Measurement intervals: 6 months`
- `Cronbach's alpha for peer rejection: 0.92`
- `Cronbach's alpha for relative deprivation: 0.88 (T1), 0.92 (T3)`
- `Cronbach's alpha for grit: 0.78`
- `Cronbach's alpha for IGD: 0.83 (T1), 0.85 (T3)`

**Complexity:** Not stated

## Benchmarks

**Tested on:** 1,065 students from two primary schools in China

**Results:**

- Indirect effect of peer rejection on IGD through relative deprivation: 0.012 (95% CI = [0.005, 0.022])

**Compared against:** Previous studies on peer rejection and IGD

**Improvement:** Significant mediation effect of relative deprivation and moderation effect of grit were found.

## Implementation Guide

**Data Structures:** Data frames for storing questionnaire responses, Statistical models for analysis

**Dependencies:** SPSS with PROCESS macro

**Core Operation:**

```python
results = PROCESS(data, model=4) # for mediation; PROCESS(data, model=15) # for moderated mediation
```

**Watch Out For:**

- Ensure proper handling of missing data across longitudinal measurements.
- Be cautious of self-report biases in questionnaire responses.
- Control for confounding variables like age and gender in analyses.

## Use This When

- Developing intervention programs for youth at risk of Internet Gaming Disorder.
- Conducting research on behavioral addictions and their psychological factors.
- Designing educational programs to enhance grit in students.

## Don't Use When

- Addressing immediate clinical interventions without considering psychological factors.
- Researching purely biological aspects of addiction without social context.
- When working with adult populations where peer rejection may not be as relevant.

## Key Concepts

peer rejection, relative deprivation, grit, Internet Gaming Disorder, longitudinal study, moderated mediation

## Connects To

- Cognitive-Behavioral Models
- Self-Regulation Theory
- Social Comparison Theory

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of behavioral addiction concepts
- Familiarity with longitudinal study design
- Knowledge of statistical mediation and moderation analysis

## Limitations

- Self-reported measures may introduce bias.
- Findings are based on a specific demographic (Chinese students).
- Longitudinal design may not capture all dynamic changes over time.

## Open Questions

- How can interventions be tailored to different age groups?
- What are the long-term effects of peer rejection on other forms of addiction?

## Abstract

Between 2019 and 2021 China rolled out a series of regulations that limited the amount of time that children under 18 could play video games. As of now minors can only access online games on certain designated days and times. One hour on Fridays, and one hour on Saturdays and Sundays. Controversial? Certainly. Necessary? Maybe so.
