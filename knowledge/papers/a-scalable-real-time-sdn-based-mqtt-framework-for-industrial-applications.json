  "summary": "This paper presents a scalable framework that integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to enhance real-time communication in industrial applications. Engineers should care because it addresses the critical need for timeliness and reliability in the rapidly evolving landscape of Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).",
