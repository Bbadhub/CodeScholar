  "summary": "The paper presents Karmem, a new interface description language and communication protocol designed to improve data exchange efficiency between WebAssembly (WASM) modules. Engineers should care because Karmem addresses significant performance issues in data transfer and interoperability across different programming languages in WASM environments.",
