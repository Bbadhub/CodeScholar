  "summary": "The paper presents a novel approach using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for the nanomechanical characterization of micro- and nanoplastics, addressing the limitations of existing spectroscopic techniques in accurately measuring particles smaller than 10 micrometers. Engineers should care because this method provides a more reliable quantitative analysis of micro- and nanoplastics, which is crucial for environmental investigations.",
