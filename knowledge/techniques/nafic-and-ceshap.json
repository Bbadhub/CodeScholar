  "one_liner": "NAFIC and CESHAP enhance feature importance methods to improve robustness and interpretability in complex and noisy data environments.",
  "how_it_works": "NAFIC assesses feature importance by accounting for noise and interactions in the data, making it more robust than traditional methods. CESHAP refines these importance scores to provide clearer insights into feature contributions. Together, they help in understanding model predictions, especially in complex industrial settings like steel production.",
