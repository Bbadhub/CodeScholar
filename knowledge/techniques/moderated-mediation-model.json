  "one_liner": "A statistical technique used to understand the relationships between variables while accounting for the influence of other variables.",
  "how_it_works": "The moderated mediation model assesses how a mediator variable influences the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable, while also considering the effect of a moderator variable. This allows researchers to explore complex interactions and indirect effects in their data. By using statistical tools like bootstrapping, the model provides insights into the significance and strength of these relationships.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect data from participants using surveys or questionnaires.",
      "2. Measure the independent variable, mediator, moderator, and dependent variable using validated scales.",
      "3. Conduct correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.",
      "4. Use statistical software (e.g., SPSS with Hayes's PROCESS macro) to test the moderated mediation model.",
      "5. Analyze the results to determine the significance of mediation and moderation effects."
