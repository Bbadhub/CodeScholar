  "one_liner": "Binaural audio technology creates immersive sound experiences that enhance navigation and interaction in digital environments.",
  "how_it_works": "Binaural audio technology simulates how humans perceive sound in a three-dimensional space, allowing users to locate sounds based on their direction and distance. This technique is particularly useful in gaming and virtual environments, where audio cues can guide players through navigation and interactions. By utilizing stereo headphones, binaural audio provides a sense of presence and immersion, making it accessible for both sighted and visually impaired users.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Initialize the game environment in a 7x7 grid layout.",
      "2. Use binaural audio to provide spatial cues for player navigation.",
      "3. Allow player movement using keyboard inputs (WASD or arrow keys).",
      "4. Emit audio signals when the player approaches interactive objects.",
      "5. Provide audio descriptions and feedback based on player actions.",
      "6. Implement mini-games that utilize sound for gameplay mechanics.",
      "7. Conclude the game when the player solves the main puzzle."
