  "how_it_works": "3D point cloud object detection involves training a machine learning model on labeled datasets of 3D point clouds. The model learns to identify and classify objects, such as aneurysms in medical imaging, by leveraging existing object detection frameworks adapted for 3D data. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment for real-time applications.",
