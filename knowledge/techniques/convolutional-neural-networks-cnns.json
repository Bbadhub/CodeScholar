  "one_liner": "CNNs are a class of deep learning algorithms primarily used for processing structured grid data such as images.",
  "how_it_works": "CNNs utilize a series of convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. They apply filters to the input data to create feature maps, which are then downsampled using pooling layers. This process allows CNNs to effectively capture patterns and anomalies, making them suitable for tasks like image recognition and anomaly detection in network flows.",
