  "category": "neural_architecture",
  "one_liner": "This technique uses deep learning models to enhance the detection of intrusions in network traffic.",
  "how_it_works": "The system employs a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting spatial features from network traffic data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for recognizing temporal patterns, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for hierarchical feature learning, and autoencoders for detecting anomalies. This multi-faceted approach allows for robust identification of both known and unknown intrusions, significantly improving detection rates and reducing false positives compared to traditional methods.",
