  "how_it_works": "This technique leverages a knowledge base that contains information about tasks, objects, and human actions. By monitoring human actions and environmental changes, the robot can analyze current task requirements and generate a dynamic action plan. The robot executes this plan while continuously updating it based on new information, allowing for real-time adjustments in collaborative settings.",
