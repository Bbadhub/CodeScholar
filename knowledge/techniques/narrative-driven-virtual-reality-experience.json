  "aliases": [],
  "category": "educational_technology",
  "one_liner": "This technique uses immersive virtual reality to enhance empathy in medical training through narrative storytelling.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique immerses users, particularly medical students, in a virtual reality environment that simulates the experiences of patients with chronic pain. By combining narrative storytelling with sensory stimuli, it aims to evoke emotional responses and deepen understanding of the patient's perspective. Users interact with the environment using gaze control and receive audio cues that guide their exploration, followed by feedback collection to assess the impact on empathy.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Initialize VR environment using Unity game engine.",
      "2. Load patient narratives and interactive elements.",
      "3. Present immersive scenes that represent chronic pain experiences.",
      "4. Use gaze control for user interaction with objects.",
      "5. Integrate spatialized audio cues to guide exploration.",
      "6. Collect user feedback through questionnaires post-experience."
