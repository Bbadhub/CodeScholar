  "how_it_works": "The Forced Oscillation Technique employs external pulse vibrations to assess the flow response of the respiratory tract. By analyzing how the respiratory system reacts to these oscillations, it quantifies respiratory impedance, which is broken down into resistance and reactance at various frequencies. This method is particularly useful for monitoring lung function in patients who cannot perform standard spirometry tests.",

      "1. Set up the Resmon\u2122Pro V3 device for FOT measurements.",

      "4. Calculate Rrs and Xrs from the measured flow and pressure data.",
