  "one_liner": "SWIN-XVR is a model that reconstructs high-resolution image sequences from low-resolution and high-resolution image inputs using a shifted window transformer architecture.",
  "how_it_works": "SWIN-XVR combines low-resolution and high-resolution image sequences to produce a high-resolution output. It employs a shifted window transformer to enhance feature extraction and effectively model spatial-temporal relationships. The model processes features through multiple transformer blocks, applying self-attention mechanisms to refine the output. Finally, it upscales the processed features to generate the desired high-resolution image sequence.",

      "4. Apply multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks for feature adjustment.",
