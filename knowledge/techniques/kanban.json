  "how_it_works": "Kanban uses a visual board to represent the workflow of tasks, helping teams to see the status of work items at a glance. By limiting the number of tasks in progress (WIP), it enhances efficiency and predictability. Teams continuously monitor and adjust their processes based on feedback, fostering a culture of iterative improvement and collaboration.",
