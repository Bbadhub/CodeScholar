  "one_liner": "This technique combines the VGG16 convolutional neural network with Grad-CAM for image classification and interpretability.",
  "how_it_works": "VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network that is pre-trained on a large dataset and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as classifying potato leaf diseases. Grad-CAM is used to generate visual explanations by highlighting the regions of the input image that are most important for the model's predictions. This combination allows for both high accuracy in classification and insights into the model's decision-making process.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Load the pre-trained VGG16 model without its classification layers.",
      "2. Freeze the convolutional layers to retain learned features.",

      "4. Apply dropout layers to prevent overfitting.",
      "5. Train the model using the potato leaf dataset.",
      "6. Use Grad-CAM to generate class activation maps for interpretability."
