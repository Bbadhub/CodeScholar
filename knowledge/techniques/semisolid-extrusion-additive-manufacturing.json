  "one_liner": "This technique allows for the creation of custom-dosed tablets using a 3D printer to extrude semisolid formulations.",
  "how_it_works": "Semisolid extrusion additive manufacturing involves preparing a semisolid formulation of a drug, such as metoprolol tartrate, and loading it into a 3D printer. The printer then extrudes the formulation according to specified dosage parameters, allowing for the production of tablets tailored to individual patient needs. Once printed, the tablets are allowed to solidify before packaging for distribution.",
