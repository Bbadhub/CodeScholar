    "Hybrid Transcription Model",

  "category": "audio_analysis",
  "one_liner": "This technique integrates traditional transcription methods with modern audio analysis to enhance speech recognition accuracy and provide insights into non-textual audio features.",
  "how_it_works": "The Hybrid Audio Analysis Framework combines acoustic, lexicon, and language models to improve transcription accuracy. It begins by preprocessing audio recordings to extract relevant features such as tone and loudness. The hybrid model then generates text while simultaneously analyzing non-textual audio characteristics, resulting in a comprehensive output that includes both transcription and audio feature analysis.",

      "4. Analyze non-textual features alongside transcription.",
      "5. Output combined results of transcription and audio analysis."
