  "category": "biofuel_technology",
  "one_liner": "This technique converts fruit waste juices into bioethanol through fermentation and distillation processes.",
  "how_it_works": "The process begins with extracting juice from various fruit wastes. This juice is then fermented using bakery yeast, which converts the sugars present into bioethanol. After fermentation, the mixture is distilled to separate and concentrate the alcohol, with a second distillation step often used to enhance purity and increase the alcohol content significantly.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect and wash fruit wastes (pineapple, mango, watermelon, pawpaw).",
      "2. Chop the fruit wastes and extract juice using a blender.",
      "3. Measure total soluble solids (TSS), pH, and specific gravity of the juice.",
      "4. Ferment the juice with 200g of bakery yeast in a sealed container at room temperature.",
      "5. Monitor fermentation parameters (alcohol content, pH, TSS) at 24-hour intervals.",
      "6. Distill the fermented broth at 78\u00b0C to collect bioethanol.",
      "7. Re-distill the collected bioethanol to improve purity."
