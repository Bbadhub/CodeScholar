  "one_liner": "This technique encrypts video content by dividing it into slices and applying unique encryption keys to each slice for enhanced security.",
  "how_it_works": "The Video Slice Encryption Scheme segments video files into slices based on I-frames, ensuring that each slice is encrypted with a unique key derived from its metadata. This approach not only secures the video content but also maintains playback compatibility, allowing for efficient retrieval and concatenation of slices during playback. By encrypting slices differently, it enhances security even for similar content.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Identify I-frames in the video.",
      "2. Create slices starting from each I-frame to the next I-frame.",
      "3. Generate unique encryption keys for each slice based on metadata (location, version number, hash value).",
      "4. Encrypt each slice using its unique key.",
      "5. Store encrypted slices and their metadata securely.",
      "6. Provide a mechanism for retrieving and concatenating slices for playback."
