  "one_liner": "This technique ensures the integrity of software artifacts through decentralized verification methods.",
  "how_it_works": "Distributed Software Build Assurance leverages reproducible builds and a software bill of materials (SBOM) to verify the integrity of software artifacts. It constructs a Merkle tree from the source code, build output, and SBOM documentation to generate a proof of integrity. This proof is then compared against a reference proof stored on a blockchain, ensuring that the software artifacts remain unmodified and trustworthy.",

    "steps": [
      "1. User downloads source code (s) and dependencies.",

      "4. User retrieves reference proof (p') from the blockchain.",
      "5. User compares p with p'.",
      "6. If p equals p', the software artifacts are verified as unmodified."
