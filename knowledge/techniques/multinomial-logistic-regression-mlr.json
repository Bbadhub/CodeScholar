  "one_liner": "MLR is used to classify outcomes into multiple categories based on independent variables.",
  "how_it_works": "Multinomial Logistic Regression extends binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes. It estimates the probabilities of different outcomes based on a set of independent variables. The model uses a softmax function to convert the linear combinations of the inputs into probabilities for each class, allowing for classification into more than two categories.",

      "1. Collect and preprocess data from prospectuses.",

      "5. Calculate class probabilities using the trained model.",
