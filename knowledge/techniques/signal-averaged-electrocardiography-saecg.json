  "one_liner": "SAECG is a non-invasive technique used to evaluate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by analyzing late potentials in ECG waveforms.",
  "how_it_works": "SAECG processes multiple ECG waveforms to detect late potentials that indicate abnormal ventricular conduction. It involves filtering the QRS complex to isolate these late potentials and measuring specific parameters. Based on these measurements, patients are classified into groups to assess their risk of ventricular arrhythmias and evaluate ventricular substrate characteristics.",

      "1. Collect ECG data from patients.",
