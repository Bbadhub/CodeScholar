  "one_liner": "This technique uses electrooculography signals to detect alcohol intoxication levels in individuals.",
  "how_it_works": "Electrooculography (EOG) signals are collected from subjects wearing smart glasses while they are under the influence of alcohol. These signals are preprocessed to eliminate noise, and relevant features are extracted for analysis. A machine learning model is then trained to classify the state of intoxication, allowing for real-time detection of whether a subject is intoxicated or sober.",
