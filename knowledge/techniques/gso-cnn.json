  "how_it_works": "GSO-CNN utilizes a hybrid approach that merges Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Initially, a population of grey wolves is created and evaluated for their recognition accuracy. The positions of these wolves are updated based on the best solutions found, which are then used to train the CNN. This optimization process enhances the CNN's parameters, leading to improved facial recognition performance across varying conditions.",
