  "how_it_works": "Improved RT-DETR leverages a transformer architecture to analyze the relationships between different regions of fabric images. By focusing on global context rather than just local features, it enhances the detection of defects in complex patterns. The model processes high-resolution images, classifying regions as defective or non-defective based on learned patterns from a custom dataset of labeled defects.",
