  "one_liner": "This technique enhances question answering systems by breaking down complex queries into manageable parts using templates and attention mechanisms.",
  "how_it_works": "The Hereditary Attentive Template-based Approach processes complex questions by first decomposing them into sub-questions. It then identifies relevant templates that guide the retrieval of information from a knowledge base. Attention mechanisms are employed to focus on the most pertinent entries, ensuring that the answers retrieved are relevant. Finally, the answers are combined to produce a structured response.",
