  "aliases": [],
  "category": "statistical_method",
  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes the mediating and moderating effects of variables in a statistical model.",
  "how_it_works": "Moderated mediation model analysis examines how a mediator variable influences the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable, while also considering the effect of a moderator variable. In this context, the mediator explains how or why two variables are related, while the moderator affects the strength or direction of this relationship. This technique is particularly useful in behavioral research to understand complex interactions among psychological factors.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect data from participants at multiple time points.",
      "2. Measure the independent variable, mediator, moderator, and dependent variable using validated scales.",
      "3. Use statistical software (e.g., PROCESS for SPSS) to analyze the data.",
      "4. Test for mediation of the mediator variable between the independent and dependent variables.",
      "5. Test for moderation of the moderator variable on the relationship between the mediator and dependent variable.",
      "6. Interpret the statistical results to understand the relationships."
    ],
    "core_equation": "Indirect effect = a * b, where a is the effect of the independent variable on the mediator, and b is the effect of the mediator on the dependent variable.",
