  "one_liner": "Deep Reinforcement Learning is a method that enables agents to learn optimal actions through trial and error, guided by rewards and user feedback.",
  "how_it_works": "Deep Reinforcement Learning combines reinforcement learning principles with deep learning techniques. It uses a neural network to approximate the value function or policy, allowing the agent to make decisions based on high-dimensional input data. The agent learns by interacting with the environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards, and adjusting its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time.",
