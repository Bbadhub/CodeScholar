  "how_it_works": "Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that helps to neutralize free radicals in the body, potentially reducing oxidative stress. In a randomized controlled trial, pediatric hemodialysis patients received either CoQ10 or a placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were measured through changes in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the blood, providing insights into the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation.",

      "1. Recruit pediatric hemodialysis patients aged 2-18 years.",
      "2. Randomly assign participants to either coenzyme Q10 or placebo group.",

      "4. Collect blood samples before and after the intervention to measure biomarkers.",
      "5. Analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods to compare groups."
