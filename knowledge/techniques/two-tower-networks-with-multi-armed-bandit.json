  "one_liner": "This technique combines two-tower neural networks with multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize personalized nudges in real-time.",
  "how_it_works": "Two-tower networks separately encode user and item features, allowing for effective matching. The multi-armed bandit algorithm dynamically selects the best nudge based on user interactions and contextual factors. This approach continuously refines recommendations by learning from real-time feedback, enhancing user engagement and conversion rates.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Encode user features using the first tower of the neural network.",
      "2. Encode item features using the second tower of the neural network.",
      "3. Use the multi-armed bandit algorithm to select the optimal nudge based on user context.",
      "4. Present the nudge to the user at the most opportune moment.",
      "5. Collect user feedback and interactions to update the model.",
      "6. Continuously refine nudges based on real-time data."
