  "one_liner": "This technique integrates BPMN diagrams and Petri nets to enhance deep learning applications through structured organizational task modeling.",
  "how_it_works": "The integration of BPMN and Petri nets involves creating structured models that represent organizational tasks. BPMN diagrams are used to visualize these tasks, which are then translated into Petri nets for formal analysis. This structured approach informs and augments deep learning models, improving their interpretability and efficiency in processing complex tasks.",
