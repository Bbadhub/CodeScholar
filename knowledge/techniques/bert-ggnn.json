  "how_it_works": "BERT-GGNN utilizes BERT to generate contextual embeddings from user-generated text. It constructs dependency and affective graphs to model relationships between words. A Gated Graph Neural Network processes these graphs, while a multi-head self-attention mechanism highlights critical sarcasm indicators, enhancing the model's detection capabilities.",

      "1. Input text is tokenized and fed into BERT to generate contextual embeddings.",

      "4. Apply a multi-head self-attention mechanism to emphasize sarcasm-indicative elements.",
      "5. Output the final predictions for sarcasm detection."
