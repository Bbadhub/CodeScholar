  "category": "machine_learning",
  "one_liner": "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training time and outputting the mode of their predictions.",
  "how_it_works": "Random Forest builds a multitude of decision trees from random subsets of the training data. Each tree makes an independent prediction, and the final output is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees, typically through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improves the model's accuracy and robustness.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Select a random subset of the training data.",
      "2. For each subset, construct a decision tree using a random selection of features.",
      "3. Repeat the process to create multiple decision trees.",
      "4. For classification, aggregate the predictions of all trees by majority vote.",
      "5. For regression, average the predictions of all trees."
    ],
    "core_equation": "output = mode(predictions from all trees) for classification; output = average(predictions from all trees) for regression",

    {
      "name": "max_depth",
      "typical_value": "None",
      "effect": "Limiting the depth of trees can prevent overfitting but may reduce model performance."

    "time": "O(n_samples * n_estimators * log(n_features))",

    "You need to identify and refactor code smells in a large codebase.",

  "common_mistakes": [
    "Not tuning hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth, which can lead to suboptimal performance.",
