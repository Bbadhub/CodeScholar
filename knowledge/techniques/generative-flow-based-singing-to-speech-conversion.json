  "one_liner": "This technique converts singing Mel-spectrograms into speech-like Mel-spectrograms while preserving phonetic information.",
  "how_it_works": "The method employs a generative flow model to transform singing Mel-spectrograms into speech-like representations. It begins by encoding the input Mel-spectrograms into a latent space, followed by predicting phoneme posteriorgrams. A modified monotonic alignment search algorithm is used to align these phoneme representations, after which a flow-based decoder generates the final speech Mel-spectrograms. The process concludes with converting these spectrograms into audio using a vocoder.",
