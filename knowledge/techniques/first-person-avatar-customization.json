  "one_liner": "This technique allows users to customize their avatars from a first-person perspective to enhance embodiment and reduce biases.",
  "how_it_works": "Users don a VR headset and use controllers to interact with their avatars directly. In first-person mode, they can grab and pull their avatar to resize it, creating a more immersive experience. This method contrasts with third-person customization, where users adjust sliders. The technique aims to improve the user's sense of embodiment and potentially reduce implicit biases through more engaging interactions.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. User dons VR headset and controllers.",
      "2. User selects avatar customization mode (first-person or third-person).",
      "3. In first-person mode, user grabs their avatar and pulls to resize it.",
      "4. In third-person mode, user adjusts sliders to modify avatar size.",
      "5. User engages in a game to enhance embodiment.",
      "6. User completes questionnaires to assess embodiment and implicit bias."
