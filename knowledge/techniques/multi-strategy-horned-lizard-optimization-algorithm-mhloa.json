It utilizes a Local Escaping Operator to help solutions escape local optima, Orthogonal Learning to refine the search process, and a RIME diversification mechanism to boost exploration. This combination allows mHLOA to effectively navigate complex solution spaces and identify optimal feature subsets.",
