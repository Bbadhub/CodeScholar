  "how_it_works": "When a user requests content, the system first checks for an exact match in the cache. If no exact match is found, it evaluates cached items for similarity to the requested content. The most similar cached item is retrieved and returned to the user. If no similar item exists, the system fetches the content from the original source. This approach reduces latency and improves cache hit rates by leveraging the similarity of cached items.",
