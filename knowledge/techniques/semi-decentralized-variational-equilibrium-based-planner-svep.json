  "how_it_works": "SVEP formulates the trajectory planning problem as a game with coupled safety constraints. Each CAV optimizes its trajectory based on information from neighboring vehicles using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.

This iterative process continues for each time step in the prediction horizon.",
