  "one_liner": "CRISPR/Cas technology enables precise editing of specific genes in organisms, particularly in agriculture.",
  "how_it_works": "CRISPR/Cas technology utilizes a guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 protein to a specific location in the genome, where it creates a double-strand break. This break triggers the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms, allowing for targeted genetic modifications. The system can be delivered into plant cells using various methods, leading to the regeneration of edited plants with improved traits.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Design sgRNA targeting the specific gene of interest.",
      "2. Assemble RNP complex with Cas9 protein and sgRNA.",
      "3. Introduce RNP complex into plant cells via protoplast transformation or other delivery methods.",
      "4. Allow the CRISPR/Cas system to induce a double-strand break at the target site.",
      "5. Activate DNA repair pathways (NHEJ or HDR) to achieve desired genetic modifications.",
      "6. Regenerate whole plants from edited cells.",
