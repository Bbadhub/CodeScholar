  "one_liner": "CNNs are deep learning models designed for processing structured grid data such as images.",
  "how_it_works": "CNNs consist of multiple layers that automatically learn to extract features from images. They use convolutional layers to detect patterns, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers to make predictions. The network is trained on labeled data, allowing it to classify images based on learned features.",
