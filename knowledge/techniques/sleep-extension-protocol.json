  "how_it_works": "The Sleep Extension Protocol involves adjusting bedtimes to increase total sleep time for participants. By comparing performance metrics under normal sleep and extended sleep conditions, the protocol assesses the impact of additional sleep on physical and cognitive tasks. This method is particularly useful for physically active individuals looking to optimize their performance through better sleep management.",

      "1. Recruit participants and ensure they meet inclusion criteria.",
      "2. Randomly assign participants to normal sleep and sleep extension conditions with a washout period.",
      "3. Monitor sleep using wrist actigraphy to measure total sleep time.",
      "4. Conduct performance assessments at specified times (8 PM, 8 AM, 4 PM).",
      "5. Compare performance metrics between conditions."
