  "one_liner": "FRR minimizes network formation time for IoT devices after power loss by caching essential configuration data.",
  "how_it_works": "FRR detects power loss events and initiates a recovery process for IoT nodes. It retrieves cached configuration data from local storage, allowing nodes to quickly establish connections with neighboring devices. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data exchanged during recovery, leading to faster network re-establishment and improved stability.",
