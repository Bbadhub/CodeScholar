  "one_liner": "TokenMixer is a hybrid architecture that combines CNNs and Vision Transformers for efficient classification of histopathology images.",
  "how_it_works": "TokenMixer processes histopathology images by first extracting features using convolutional layers. It then tokenizes these features and passes them through a Vision Transformer (ViT) for enhanced classification accuracy. This method is particularly effective for tasks like breast cancer diagnosis, where both feature extraction and classification are critical.",

      "1. Preprocess histopathology images by resizing to 224x224 pixels.",
      "2. Split data into training, validation, and test sets.",

      "4. Extract features using TokenLearner and ConvMixer.",
      "5. Combine features in TokenMixer and pass through ViT for classification.",
      "6. Output predictions for binary and multi-class classification."
