  "one_liner": "Ensemble models combine predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy and stability.",
  "how_it_works": "Ensemble models leverage the strengths of various algorithms by combining their predictions. In this approach, different models such as MLP, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained on the same dataset. The final prediction is made through a soft-voting mechanism, where the outputs of each model are averaged to produce a more reliable result. This method helps to mitigate the weaknesses of individual models and improve overall performance.",
