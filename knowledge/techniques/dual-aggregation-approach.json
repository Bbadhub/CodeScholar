  "one_liner": "A method to enhance federated learning by filtering out poisoning attacks through dual aggregation of model updates.",
  "how_it_works": "The dual-aggregation approach operates by collecting model updates from multiple clients in a federated learning setting. It first performs an initial aggregation to identify and filter out potential outliers. A second aggregation step is then applied to the remaining updates, ensuring that only trustworthy contributions are used to update the global model. This process is repeated for subsequent training rounds to maintain model integrity against adversarial attacks.",
