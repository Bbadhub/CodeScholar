  "how_it_works": "Tentative operations leverage Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to allow users to edit local copies of geospatial data. When a user makes an edit, a new CRDT element is generated and inserted into their local data structure. This element is then transmitted to other users, who integrate it into their own local copies while resolving any conflicts using predefined strategies.",

      "4. Transmit the new element to all other sites.",
      "5. Each site integrates the new element into their local data structure based on the originLeft parameter.",
