  "how_it_works": "SmartScanPCOS analyzes patient data to predict PCOS by first collecting relevant information such as symptoms and medical history. The data is preprocessed to ensure quality, followed by the selection of significant features that contribute to the prediction. A machine learning model is then trained on these features, and explainable AI techniques are employed to provide insights into the model's predictions. Finally, the model is validated using a separate test dataset to ensure accuracy.",
