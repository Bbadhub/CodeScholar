  "one_liner": "This technique normalizes 3D point cloud data of fingerprints by fitting B-spline curves to unwarp the shape.",
  "how_it_works": "The method processes 3D point cloud data by slicing it in the Y-direction to create thin sections. For each slice, it extracts the Z values and fits a B-spline curve to these values. This curve acts as a baseline, allowing the Z values to be normalized by subtracting the fitted curve from them. The process is repeated for all slices to achieve a fully normalized 3D representation of the fingerprint.",
