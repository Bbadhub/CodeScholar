  "one_liner": "TMS is a non-invasive method used to stimulate neural activity in the brain using magnetic fields.",
  "how_it_works": "TMS involves placing a magnetic coil on the scalp, which generates brief magnetic pulses that induce electrical currents in the brain. This stimulation can enhance or inhibit neuronal activity, depending on the frequency and duration of the pulses. It is particularly useful for modulating brain regions associated with specific functions, such as reward processing in opioid users.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Identify opioid users with blunted anterior midcingulate response.",
      "2. Prepare TMS equipment and set parameters for stimulation.",
      "3. Apply TMS to the prefrontal cortex at specified intervals.",
      "4. Measure anterior midcingulate response to reward stimuli pre- and post-TMS.",
      "5. Analyze changes in neural response to determine normalization."
