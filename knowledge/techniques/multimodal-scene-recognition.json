  "how_it_works": "Multimodal scene recognition combines visual data from RGB images with semantic segmentation maps to create a more informative representation of a scene. This integration allows the model to utilize depth information and spatial relationships, which improves its ability to identify complex structures. By training on both data types, the model learns to recognize various scene categories more effectively.",
