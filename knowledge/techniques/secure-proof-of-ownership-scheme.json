  "how_it_works": "The Secure Proof of Ownership Scheme allows a user to prove ownership of a file stored on a server without transferring the entire file. The server generates a random seed and challenges the user to compute a response based on the file and the seed. The user sends this response back to the server, which then verifies it against its own computation to confirm ownership.",

    "steps": [
      "User sends file tag to server.",

      "User computes response using the entire file and the seed.",
      "User sends the response to the server.",
      "Server computes its own response using the stored file and compares it with the user's response.",
