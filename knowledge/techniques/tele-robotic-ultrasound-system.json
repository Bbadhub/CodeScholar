  "one_liner": "A tele-robotic ultrasound system enables remote ultrasound examinations via a robotic arm controlled over a 5G network.",
  "how_it_works": "The tele-robotic ultrasound system allows a radiologist to control a robotic arm that applies ultrasound probes to a patient remotely. The system captures ultrasound images in real-time and displays them to the radiologist, who can communicate with an assistant on-site. This setup facilitates examinations in locations where direct access to radiologists is limited, ensuring timely medical assessments.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Patient is positioned appropriately for the ultrasound examination.",
      "2. The radiologist remotely controls the robotic arm using a console.",
      "3. The robotic arm applies ultrasound probes to the patient's body.",
      "4. Ultrasound images are captured and displayed in real-time.",
      "5. The radiologist communicates with an assistant at the patient site for support.",
      "6. The examination is completed, and findings are recorded."
