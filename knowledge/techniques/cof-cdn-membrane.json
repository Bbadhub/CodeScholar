  "one_liner": "The COF-CDN membrane is designed for ultrafast desalination using hourglass-shaped nanochannels.",
  "how_it_works": "The COF-CDN membrane is created by assembling amino-cyclodextrin nanoparticles onto a covalent organic framework (COF) membrane, forming hourglass-shaped nanochannels. These channels have a hydrophilic conical entrance that facilitates water transport and a hydrophobic spout that enhances ion rejection. This unique structure optimizes the desalination process, allowing for high water flux and effective salt rejection.",
