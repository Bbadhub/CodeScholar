  "how_it_works": "The Lead Qualification Model is trained on historical lead data to identify patterns that indicate the quality of leads. Once trained, the model can score new leads based on these patterns, allowing sales teams to prioritize their efforts effectively. The model is integrated into a CRM system, where it continuously updates with new data to improve its accuracy over time.",

      "1. Collect historical lead data from the CRM.",

      "3. Train a machine learning model using the processed data.",
      "4. Validate the model's performance on a separate dataset.",
      "5. Integrate the model into the CRM to score incoming leads.",
      "6. Continuously update the model with new lead data for improved accuracy."
