  "one_liner": "AGM-AI generates real-time music tailored to users' physiological states to enhance emotional synchrony.",
  "how_it_works": "AGM-AI operates in two stages: a Foundational Model that learns from diverse physiological responses to music, and Individualized Tuning that adapts the system to each user's unique responses. It collects real-time physiological data while users listen to music, analyzes musical features, and trains a neural network to create a model. The system then generates music that aligns with the user's current physiological state, facilitating emotional connection and synchrony between users.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect physiological data (EEG, ECG, GSR, motion) while participants listen to music.",
      "2. Analyze musical features (tempo, loudness, timbre, harmony, rhythm) using signal preprocessing and feature extraction.",
      "3. Train a neural network on synchronized datasets to form the Foundational Model.",
      "4. For Individualized Tuning, collect user-specific biometric responses to the Foundational Model music.",
      "5. Identify outlier responses and adapt the Local Adaptation Layer to refine music generation.",
      "6. Generate music in real-time based on live biometric data using AI-driven synthesis.",
      "7. Facilitate interpersonal synchronization by sharing biometric data between users."
