  "one_liner": "This technique calculates the overall channel capacity of THz transceivers by analyzing narrow sub-bands of the total bandwidth.",

These individual capacities are then aggregated to determine the overall channel capacity. This approach is particularly useful in mitigating interference from non-white molecular noise, which can affect signal quality in painted environments.",
