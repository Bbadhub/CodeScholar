  "one_liner": "This technique enables secure multi-keyword searches on encrypted data without decryption.",
  "how_it_works": "The Hybrid Encrypted Search Framework combines an improved TF-IDF weighting scheme with the Apriori algorithm for semantic keyword expansion. It allows users to perform searches on encrypted data while maintaining confidentiality. By generating obscured keyword indices, it resists potential attacks and ensures high recall in search results.",
