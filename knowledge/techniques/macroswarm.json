  "how_it_works": "MacroSwarm models swarm behavior using an augmented event structure, allowing each device to operate independently while coordinating with neighbors. Each device continuously senses its environment and gathers messages from nearby devices. It then computes new values based on the sensed data and decides on actions, which are communicated through messages and actuations. This loop continues, enabling dynamic and resilient swarm behaviors.",
