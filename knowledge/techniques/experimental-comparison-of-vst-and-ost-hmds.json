  "one_liner": "This technique compares the performance of tasks using Virtual Spatial Technology (VST) and Optical Spatial Technology (OST) head-mounted displays (HMDs) against unaided vision.",
  "how_it_works": "Participants are divided into two groups, each using either VST or OST HMDs to perform specific tasks. Their performance is measured in terms of completion time, accuracy, and self-reported discomfort. The results are statistically analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each HMD type compared to unaided vision.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Recruit participants and divide them into two groups.",
      "2. Assign each group to perform tasks with either VST or OST HMDs.",
      "3. Each participant performs tasks twice: once with HMD and once without.",
      "4. Record completion time, accuracy, and self-reported discomfort.",
      "5. Analyze the collected data statistically to compare performance across conditions."
