  "one_liner": "SAALO combines Ant Lion Optimization with simulated annealing to effectively resolve integer ambiguities in GNSS applications.",
  "how_it_works": "SAALO enhances the Ant Lion Optimization strategy by incorporating simulated annealing to improve convergence and escape local optima. It initializes a population of ants and ant lions, where ants wander within the traps of their respective ant lions. The algorithm iteratively updates the positions of ants based on their wandering and the best ant lion found. Simulated annealing is then applied to decide whether to accept new positions, allowing for a more robust search in complex solution spaces.",
