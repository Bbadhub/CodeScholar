# Static Code Analysis

*Also known as: SCA*

**Static code analysis evaluates code quality without executing the program.**

**Category:** optimization_algorithm  
**Maturity:** proven

## How It Works

Static code analysis tools scan source code to identify potential errors, code smells, and adherence to coding standards. These tools analyze various metrics such as readability, maintainability, and complexity. By comparing code snippets generated by different sources, such as AI tools and novice programmers, the effectiveness of code quality can be assessed.

## Algorithm

**Input:** Code snippets (string format)

**Output:** Quality assessment metrics (numerical scores)

**Steps:**

1. 1. Generate code snippets using an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT).
2. 2. Collect equivalent code snippets written by novice programmers.
3. 3. Apply static code analysis tools to both sets of snippets.
4. 4. Compare the analysis results based on predefined quality metrics.
5. 5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the AI tool in improving code quality.

**Core Operation:** `Quality metrics = f(readability, maintainability, complexity)`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Value | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `analysis_tool` | SonarQube | Different tools may yield varying results based on their algorithms. |
| `metrics` | ['readability', 'maintainability', 'complexity'] | Changing metrics can focus the analysis on different aspects of code quality. |

## Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) where n is the number of lines of code analyzed
- **Space:** O(1) if only summary metrics are stored
- **In practice:** Performance may vary based on the complexity of the codebase and the analysis tool used.

## Implementation

```python
def static_code_analysis(code_snippets: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    results = {}
    for snippet in code_snippets:
        metrics = analyze(snippet)
        results[snippet] = metrics
    return results
```

## Common Mistakes

- Neglecting to configure the analysis tool properly.
- Overlooking the context of the code when interpreting metrics.
- Failing to update the analysis tool to the latest version.

## Use When

- You want to evaluate the quality of code written by beginners.
- You are exploring AI tools to assist in programming education.
- You need to improve maintainability in codebases.

## Avoid When

- You require real-time code execution feedback.
- You are working with highly specialized programming languages not supported by AI tools.
- You need to analyze performance metrics rather than code quality.

## Tradeoffs

**Strengths:**

- Identifies potential issues before runtime.
- Improves code quality and maintainability.
- Can be automated in CI/CD pipelines.

**Weaknesses:**

- May produce false positives or negatives.
- Does not catch runtime errors.
- Can be limited by the capabilities of the analysis tool.

**Compared To:**

- **vs Dynamic Code Analysis:** Use static analysis for early detection of issues; use dynamic analysis for runtime behavior.
