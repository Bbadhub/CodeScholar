  "one_liner": "MOSA is an optimization technique that balances exploration and exploitation to solve multi-objective problems.",

As the algorithm progresses, it gradually reduces exploration in favor of refining the best solutions found. This balance allows it to effectively navigate complex solution spaces while optimizing for multiple conflicting objectives.",
