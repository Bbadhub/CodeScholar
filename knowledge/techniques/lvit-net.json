  "how_it_works": "LViT-Net employs a dual-branch encoder structure to extract both local and global features from pedestrian images. The local branch captures fine-grained details using a multi-scale feature fusion module, while the global branch utilizes a Vision Transformer to gather semantic information. These features are then fused to create a robust representation for person identification.",

      "1. Input pedestrian images into the local and global branches.",

      "4. In the global branch, segment images into patches and process them through a Vision Transformer.",
      "5. Apply the Dual Feature Cross Fusion (DFCF) module to fuse local and global features.",
