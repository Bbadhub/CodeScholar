  "one_liner": "OMNIJET-\u03b1 is a model designed for generating synthetic jet sequences in particle physics using transfer learning.",
  "how_it_works": "OMNIJET-\u03b1 employs a two-step approach: first, it pre-trains on a large dataset of jet features to learn general characteristics. Then, it fine-tunes on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt to particular jet types. This method allows the model to generalize well while also honing in on the nuances of real-world data, making it effective for generating synthetic data in jet physics.",
