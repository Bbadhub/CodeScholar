  "one_liner": "A model that enables agents to infer and adapt to human intentions and beliefs in real-time for effective collaboration.",
  "how_it_works": "The Dynamic Mentalizing Model allows agents to observe human actions and infer their intentions and beliefs. By integrating perception, action planning, and communication, the model enables agents to adjust their tasks dynamically. This continuous adaptation facilitates fluid collaboration between humans and agents in real-time environments.",

      "1. Observe the actions of the human partner.",

      "4. Communicate any changes or needs to the human partner implicitly or explicitly.",
      "5. Continuously monitor the environment and partner's actions to adaptively coordinate tasks."
