  "how_it_works": "MM-HGT-Bot constructs a heterogeneous graph that represents users, their relationships, and their tweets. It processes user features and tweet content to create distinct representations. The model employs a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to learn patterns from these relationships and combines them with content-based representations to classify users as bots or humans.",

      "4. Aggregate tweet representations using attention scores to create content-aware user representations.",
      "5. Use a fusion gate to combine user features and content-aware representations.",
