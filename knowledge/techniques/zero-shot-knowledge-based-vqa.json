  "one_liner": "This technique answers questions about images without fine-tuning on specific datasets by using frozen language models.",
  "how_it_works": "The method processes an image and a natural language question by first extracting visual features from the image using a vision model. It then utilizes a frozen language model to interpret the question. The visual features and language representation are combined to generate a coherent answer. This approach allows for quick deployment without the need for extensive training.",
