  "how_it_works": "The Adaptive Multi-Stage Bat Algorithm builds upon the traditional Bat Algorithm by incorporating a multi-stage structure that adapts the loudness and pulse rate based on the search process. This adaptation allows the algorithm to better explore the solution space and reduces the risk of premature convergence. By dynamically adjusting these parameters, the algorithm can effectively balance exploration and exploitation throughout the optimization process.",
