  "category": "robotics, human-robot interaction",
  "one_liner": "This technique enables robots to respond to specific sounds associated with fearful or shocking events, mimicking human reactions to enhance sociability.",
  "how_it_works": "The system continuously monitors the environment for sound inputs, analyzing them to identify patterns that correspond to fearful or shocking events. Upon detection, the robot triggers predefined reactions that resemble human responses. This approach aims to improve the robot's ability to interact socially with humans, making it more relatable and effective in social contexts.",
