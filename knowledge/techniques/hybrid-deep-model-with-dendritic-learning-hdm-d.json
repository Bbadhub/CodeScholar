  "aliases": [],
  "category": "neural_architecture",
  "one_liner": "HDM-D is a deep learning model that combines CNN, RNN, and dendritic learning for improved classification of modulated signals.",
  "how_it_works": "The HDM-D model consists of three main components: a CNN block for feature extraction, an RNN block for processing temporal sequences, and a dendritic block for integrating features and classification. The dendritic layer enhances the model's ability to process non-linear relationships compared to traditional fully connected layers. This architecture is particularly effective for tasks involving complex signal classification in environments with high noise levels.",

      "4. Integrate the processed features using the dendritic layer.",
      "5. Apply ReLU activation and summation to generate the final output."
