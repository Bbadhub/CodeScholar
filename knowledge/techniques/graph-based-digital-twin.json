  "how_it_works": "This technique constructs a graph that represents urban areas and their spatial dependencies. It integrates real-time data on environmental factors and emergency calls to analyze high-risk zones. By simulating various emergency response scenarios, it optimizes resource allocation, such as ambulance dispatch, based on predicted needs. The model is continuously updated with new data to improve accuracy over time.",
