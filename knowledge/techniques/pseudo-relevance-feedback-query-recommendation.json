  "one_liner": "This technique recommends queries to enhance the relevance of search results based on user interaction data.",
  "how_it_works": "The method leverages user interaction data and patterns from previous search results to recommend queries that improve relevance. It analyzes user behavior to generate potential feedback queries, ranks them based on relevance metrics, and presents the top recommendations to the user. This iterative feedback loop helps refine the recommendations over time.",
