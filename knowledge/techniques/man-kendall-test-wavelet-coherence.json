  "one_liner": "This technique assesses trends and relationships in time series data, particularly in environmental and agricultural contexts.",
  "how_it_works": "The Man-Kendall Test is used to identify trends in time series data, such as temperature records. Wavelet Coherence complements this by analyzing the relationship between two time series across different frequencies. Together, they provide insights into how fluctuations in one variable, like temperature, affect another, such as crop yields over time.",

      "4. Apply Wavelet Coherence to analyze the relationship between temperature variability and rice yields.",
