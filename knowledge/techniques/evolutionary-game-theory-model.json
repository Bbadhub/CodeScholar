  "how_it_works": "Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) analyzes how players adapt their strategies based on the outcomes of their decisions and the decisions of others. Each player in the model has a set of strategies and utility functions that determine their payoffs. The model uses replicator dynamics to simulate how strategies evolve over time, allowing for the identification of stable strategies that can withstand competition from alternative strategies.",
