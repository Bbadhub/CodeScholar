  "how_it_works": "Agent-based modeling involves creating individual agents that represent entities in a system, such as users in a dating app. These agents interact based on defined rules and can change their states based on outcomes of interactions, such as acceptance or rejection. The model simulates these interactions over time to observe patterns and dynamics, providing insights into complex behaviors and system performance.",
