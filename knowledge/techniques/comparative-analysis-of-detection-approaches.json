  "how_it_works": "The technique involves collecting a set of studies on hate speech detection and categorizing the approaches used. Each approach is evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. The effectiveness of these methods is then compared to draw conclusions about their relative strengths and weaknesses.",
