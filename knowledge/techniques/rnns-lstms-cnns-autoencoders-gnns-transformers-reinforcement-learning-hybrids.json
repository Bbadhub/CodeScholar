  "one_liner": "A collection of deep learning architectures used for predicting market movements in algorithmic trading.",
  "how_it_works": "Deep learning models like RNNs and LSTMs are employed to analyze historical financial time series data to capture temporal dependencies. These models are trained on past market data to predict future price movements or generate trading signals. The architecture choice depends on the specific trading task and the nature of the data. After training, the models are validated on unseen data to ensure their effectiveness in real-world trading scenarios.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Identify the trading task and data requirements.",
      "2. Select an appropriate deep learning architecture (e.g., RNN, LSTM).",

      "4. Train the model using historical data.",
      "5. Validate the model's performance on unseen data.",
      "6. Implement the model in a trading strategy."
