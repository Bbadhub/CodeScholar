  "how_it_works": "Complex single-valued neutrosophic soft sets provide a framework for representing uncertainty in decision-making scenarios. By combining set theory operations with decision criteria, this technique evaluates multiple attributes relevant to a specific context, such as hospital site selection. The overall scores for potential options are calculated based on these attributes, allowing for a ranked list of choices based on their suitability.",
