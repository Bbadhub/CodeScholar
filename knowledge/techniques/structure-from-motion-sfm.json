  "one_liner": "SfM is a technique used to reconstruct 3D structures from a series of 2D images taken from different angles.",
  "how_it_works": "SfM processes multiple overlapping images to identify common features and estimate their 3D positions. It uses geometric principles to triangulate points in space, creating a dense point cloud representation of the scene. This point cloud can then be analyzed for various applications, such as estimating vegetation volume and litter accumulation in ecological studies.",
