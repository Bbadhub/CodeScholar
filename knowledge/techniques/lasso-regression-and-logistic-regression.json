  "how_it_works": "LASSO regression is employed to identify and select significant predictors from a dataset, effectively reducing dimensionality by penalizing less important features. Once the relevant predictors are determined, logistic regression is used to model the relationship between these predictors and the outcome variable, in this case, stunting in children. The final model can be visualized using a nomogram, which helps in understanding the contributions of each predictor to the risk of stunting.",

      "1. Collect data on children under three years old, including risk factors.",
      "2. Split the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.",

      "4. Use logistic regression to model the relationship between predictors and stunting.",
      "5. Create a nomogram based on the logistic regression results.",
      "6. Validate the model using the validation set and assess performance metrics."
