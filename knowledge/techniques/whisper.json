  ],
  "category": "neural_architecture",
  "one_liner": "Whisper is a transformer-based model designed to decode and analyze audio signals, particularly for sentiment analysis in animal vocalizations.",
  "how_it_works": "Whisper processes audio recordings by first converting them into a standardized format and filtering out background noise. It then segments the audio into manageable clips and feeds these into the model, which generates text-like outputs. These outputs are analyzed for sentiment indicators, allowing researchers to correlate emotional states with welfare conditions in animals.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect and preprocess audio recordings of chicken vocalizations.",
      "2. Convert audio files to a standardized format (16 kHz, mono).",
      "3. Filter background noise using spectral de-noising.",
      "4. Normalize audio intensity and segment into clips (1-5 seconds).",
      "5. Input preprocessed audio segments into the Whisper model.",
      "6. Analyze the generated text outputs for sentiment using NLP tools.",
      "7. Correlate sentiment scores with known welfare indicators."
