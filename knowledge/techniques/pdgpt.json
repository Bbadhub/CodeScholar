  "one_liner": "PDGPT is a large language model tailored for acquiring phase diagram information in magnesium alloys.",
  "how_it_works": "PDGPT is trained specifically on magnesium alloy phase diagrams by integrating domain-specific knowledge. It employs three main strategies: using unmodified large language models (LLMs) enhanced with prompt-engineering, implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for information retrieval, and creating new models through Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). This combination allows the model to provide accurate insights related to magnesium alloys during inference.",
