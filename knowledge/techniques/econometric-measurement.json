  "how_it_works": "This technique involves collecting survey data to explore the relationship between a specific variable, such as health insurance affiliation, and an outcome, like infant mortality rates. Econometric models are then applied to control for confounding variables that may affect the results. By estimating the causal effects, researchers can draw conclusions about the impact of the variable on the outcome of interest.",
