  "one_liner": "This technique enables robots to engage in natural conversations with users through integration with ChatGPT.",
  "how_it_works": "The ChatGPT-based Robot Control Platform captures user speech input and converts it to text. It checks if the input corresponds to predefined robot actions; if not, it queries ChatGPT for a response. The robot then outputs the response through speech and visual displays, facilitating a seamless interaction loop until the user ends the conversation.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Capture user speech input using speech recognition.",
      "2. Convert speech to text.",
      "3. Check if the input matches predefined robot actions.",
      "4. If matched, execute the action; if not, send the text to ChatGPT.",
      "5. Receive response from ChatGPT.",
      "6. Display response on the robot's tablet and convert it to speech.",
      "7. Repeat until the user ends the interaction."
