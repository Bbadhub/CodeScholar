  "one_liner": "This technique predicts brain age from MRI scans and calculates the brain age gap (BAG) to assess brain health.",
  "how_it_works": "Brain age prediction algorithms utilize machine learning models trained on structural MRI data to estimate the age of an individual's brain. The predicted brain age is then compared to the individual's chronological age to calculate the brain age gap (BAG). This gap can provide insights into brain health and the effects of various factors, such as occupational stress, on cognitive function.",
