  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes behavioral data to identify patterns and correlations in attitudes towards specific groups, such as individuals with invisible disabilities.",
  "how_it_works": "Behavioral tendency analysis involves collecting data through surveys and observational studies to assess attitudes towards a particular subject. The collected data is then analyzed using statistical methods to uncover patterns and correlations. This analysis helps in understanding how different groups are perceived and can inform design and policy decisions.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Design survey to assess attitudes towards invisible disabilities.",
      "2. Collect behavioral data in public spaces.",

      "5. Report findings and implications for design."
