  "one_liner": "FastSLAM 2.0 is a particle filter-based algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that efficiently estimates a robot's pose and the map of its environment.",
  "how_it_works": "FastSLAM 2.0 utilizes a set of particles to represent possible robot poses and corresponding maps. Each particle is updated based on motion commands and sensor measurements. The algorithm incorporates data association to match observed landmarks with those in the map, and it uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate landmark positions. Finally, particles are resampled based on their importance weights to focus on the most likely states.",
