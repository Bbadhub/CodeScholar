  "how_it_works": "NeRF employs a neural network to map 3D spatial coordinates and 2D viewing directions to color and density values, capturing the volumetric properties of a scene. The network is trained on a dataset of images with known camera poses, allowing it to learn how to render the scene from different viewpoints. The rendering process utilizes volume rendering techniques to generate the final images based on the learned representation.",
