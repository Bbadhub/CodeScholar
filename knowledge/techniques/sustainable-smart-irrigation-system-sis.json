  "how_it_works": "The Sustainable Smart Irrigation System utilizes a solar PV panel to power an Arduino-based control system that manages soil moisture sensors and a water pump. It collects rainwater for irrigation and employs IoT technology to monitor soil moisture levels, adjusting irrigation schedules based on real-time data. The system also sends notifications to users regarding irrigation status via GSM.",

      "4. Collect rainwater and store it in a tank.",
      "5. Calculate daily water requirements based on plant needs.",
      "6. Optimize PV panel size based on energy consumption.",
