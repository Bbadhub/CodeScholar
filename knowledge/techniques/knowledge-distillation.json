  "one_liner": "Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge from a complex model (teacher) to a simpler model (student) to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.",
  "how_it_works": "In knowledge distillation, a high-capacity teacher model is first trained on a dataset to learn complex patterns. The student model, which is typically smaller and more efficient, is then trained using the outputs of the teacher model rather than the original labels. This process allows the student to learn from the teacher's knowledge, enabling it to achieve competitive performance with reduced computational requirements.",

      "5. Compute the cross-entropy loss for the student model.",
