  "how_it_works": "The Traffic Clearance Routing Algorithm decodes a polyline string from Google Maps into waypoints and filters these waypoints based on a specified distance. It continuously tracks the vehicle's location to ensure that the route is updated in real-time, allowing emergency vehicles to navigate through traffic efficiently. This method significantly reduces computational load while maintaining route accuracy.",

      "1. Decode the route polyline string into waypoints.",
