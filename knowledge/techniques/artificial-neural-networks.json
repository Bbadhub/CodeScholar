  "one_liner": "Artificial Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain used for pattern recognition and prediction tasks.",
  "how_it_works": "Artificial Neural Networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. The network learns to map input data to output predictions by adjusting weights through a training process. This is achieved by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs using optimization techniques like backpropagation.",
