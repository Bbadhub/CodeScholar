  "how_it_works": "The nFRAs method involves identifying suitable areas for fisheries restrictions based on ecological and fisheries criteria. This is achieved by integrating data from fish species inventories and macrozoobenthos sampling to evaluate the spatial distribution of species and habitats. The process culminates in proposing areas for nFRAs, followed by public consultations and monitoring of ecological impacts post-establishment.",

      "4. Propose suitable areas for nFRAs based on the analysis.",
