  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes textual data to identify patterns and categorize content based on specific criteria.",
  "how_it_works": "Systematic qualitative content analysis involves collecting textual submissions and coding them based on predefined categories. The coded data is then subjected to clustering techniques to reveal underlying patterns and insights. This method is particularly useful for understanding diverse perspectives and policy preferences in complex issues like environmental treaties.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect pre-session submissions from countries.",
      "2. Code submissions based on proposed measures and targets.",
      "3. Perform cluster analysis using K-modes algorithm to categorize submissions.",
      "4. Analyze political-economic factors influencing clustering.",
      "5. Map the distribution of measures across the plastics value chain."

  "use_when": [
    "You need to understand the diverse policy preferences of countries regarding environmental treaties.",
