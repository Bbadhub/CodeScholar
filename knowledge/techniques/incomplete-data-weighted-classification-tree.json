  "one_liner": "This technique classifies tuples in multidimensional datasets with missing values to optimize skyline queries.",
  "how_it_works": "The Incomplete Data Weighted Classification Tree constructs a classification tree that accounts for missing attributes by assigning weights to present and absent values. It classifies data into buckets based on these weights, allowing for efficient execution of skyline queries. By minimizing unnecessary comparisons, it enhances query performance in scenarios with incomplete data.",

      "1. Select a training set from the incomplete dataset (70% of the data).",

      "3. For each dimension, assign weights based on missing values (0 for missing, 1 for present).",
      "4. Store dimension values in intermediate nodes and classify data into leaf nodes.",
      "5. Use horizontal indexing to export classified data into buckets.",
