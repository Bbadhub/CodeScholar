  "one_liner": "Mamba is a selective state model designed for improved recognition of animal actions in video data.",
  "how_it_works": "Mamba processes video frames of animal actions by first extracting relevant features. It then applies selective state modeling to dynamically focus on key features based on the context of the action being observed. Finally, a neural network classifies the action and outputs the recognized label, achieving higher accuracy compared to traditional models.",
