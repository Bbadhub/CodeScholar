  "how_it_works": "Applied Key Information Extraction leverages Amazon Textract to perform initial OCR processing on documents, extracting both text and layout data. This extracted data is then structured using user-defined prompts and processed through a large language model (LLM) to produce a final structured JSON output. The technique includes a rule-based post-processing module to refine specific fields and calculate confidence scores for the extracted information.",
