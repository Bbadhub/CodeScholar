  "how_it_works": "The 2P-FSID method operates in two distinct phases. In the first phase, it identifies relevant features from the dataset using statistical measures. The second phase evaluates the computational efficiency of these selected features, ensuring that only the most effective ones are retained for use in the intrusion detection system. This dual approach optimizes both the performance and efficiency of the system.",
