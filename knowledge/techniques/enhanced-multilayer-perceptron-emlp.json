  "category": "neural_architecture",
  "one_liner": "EMLP is an advanced version of the multilayer perceptron designed for effective feature extraction and classification in complex datasets.",
  "how_it_works": "The Enhanced Multilayer Perceptron improves upon traditional MLP by using optimized weight initialization, adaptive learning rates, and additional hidden layers. This architecture allows the model to better capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. It is particularly effective for datasets with both categorical and numerical features, making it suitable for tasks like early disease detection.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Preprocess the dataset by converting categorical features to numerical values and scaling numerical features to a range of 0 to 1.",
      "2. Initialize the EMLP model with the specified architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer).",
      "3. Train the model using the processed dataset with backpropagation and regularization techniques.",
      "4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall."
