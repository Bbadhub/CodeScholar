  "how_it_works": "CTTA utilizes a pre-trained transformer model as a surrogate to create adversarial samples. It combines perturbations with chain-of-thought reasoning techniques to construct prompts that mislead LLMs. The effectiveness of these adversarial prompts is then evaluated against target LLMs to assess their robustness against such attacks.",
