  "how_it_works": "Probabilistic cardinality is applied to estimate the size of large data sets, which is particularly useful when dealing with uncertain or incomplete data. Replicability notations are then used to maintain consistency in data analysis across different instances or sources. This combination allows for more reliable insights and metrics derived from big data, enhancing decision-making processes.",
