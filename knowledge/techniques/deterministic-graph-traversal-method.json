  "one_liner": "This technique classifies white blood cells (WBCs) using a directed graph and a Boolean feature vector derived from images.",
  "how_it_works": "The method constructs a directed graph where nodes represent WBC classes and edges represent morphological connections. A Boolean feature vector is generated from segmented WBC images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The algorithm then performs a deterministic traversal of the graph based on this feature vector to classify the WBCs. This approach leverages domain knowledge to enhance classification accuracy while maintaining lower complexity than traditional deep learning models.",
