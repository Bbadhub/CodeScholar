  "category": "neural_architecture",
  "one_liner": "YOLOv5 is a real-time object detection model that identifies and classifies objects in images efficiently.",
  "how_it_works": "YOLOv5 processes images through a single neural network that divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It uses a series of convolutional layers to extract features from the image and applies non-maximum suppression to filter out overlapping boxes. This allows for fast and accurate detection of multiple objects in a single pass.",

    "steps": [
      "Load the input image data.",
      "Resize the image to the required dimensions (e.g., 640x480 pixels).",
      "Pass the image through the YOLOv5 model to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities.",
      "Apply non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundant boxes.",
      "Output the classified images with detected objects."
    ],
