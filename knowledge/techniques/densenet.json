  "one_liner": "DenseNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that improves feature propagation and reduces the number of parameters by connecting each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion.",
  "how_it_works": "DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer, allowing for better feature reuse and reducing the number of parameters. This architecture enables gradients to flow more easily during training, which helps in learning more complex features. The model is typically pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as image classification.",
