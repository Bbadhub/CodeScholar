  "how_it_works": "This technique involves a systematic review of existing literature to identify how DevOps practices can be integrated with the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). It establishes a mapping framework that outlines key capabilities and maturity levels for software development teams. The framework is validated through expert feedback and provides guidelines for implementation, ensuring a structured approach to adopting DevOps within the CMMI context.",
