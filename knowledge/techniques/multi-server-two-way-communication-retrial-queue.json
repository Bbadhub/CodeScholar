  "one_liner": "This technique models a multi-server queue system that incorporates retrial queues and two-way communication under varying server states.",
  "how_it_works": "The multi-server two-way communication retrial queue allows incoming calls to enter a retrial queue when all servers are busy. During idle times, servers can make outgoing calls. The model also accounts for disasters that may cause server failures, requiring repairs. By analyzing the system's state transitions, performance metrics such as average queue size and server utilization can be derived.",
