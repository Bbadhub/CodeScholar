  "how_it_works": "Multi-view representation learning combines different types of data perspectives, such as transitions, spatial distributions, and temporal patterns, to form a unified representation. This approach is particularly useful in urban studies, where understanding the dynamics of human movement can inform land-use classification and urban governance. By leveraging diverse data sources, the technique enhances the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data.",
