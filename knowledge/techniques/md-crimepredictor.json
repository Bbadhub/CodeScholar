  "one_liner": "MD-CrimePredictor forecasts criminal activities in multi-density crime hotspots using clustering and predictive modeling.",
  "how_it_works": "MD-CrimePredictor first identifies crime hotspots through a multi-density clustering algorithm. It then applies SARIMA and LSTM models to forecast crime trends within these hotspots. The method adapts to the unique characteristics of each hotspot by automatically computing densities and shapes, allowing for tailored predictions without predefined divisions.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Gather spatio-temporal crime data.",

      "4. Train SARIMA and LSTM models on the data from each hotspot.",
      "5. Evaluate the performance of both models using error measures.",
