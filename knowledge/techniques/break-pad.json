  "one_liner": "Break-Pad injects random padding packets into traffic bursts to enhance privacy in the Tor network.",
  "how_it_works": "Break-Pad operates by monitoring incoming traffic packets and injecting a random number of padding packets when a specified threshold of consecutive packets is reached. This randomness disrupts predictable traffic patterns, making it harder for adversaries to analyze the traffic flow. The technique dynamically adjusts the threshold and the number of padding packets based on sampled probability distributions.",
