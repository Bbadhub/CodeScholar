  "one_liner": "Sesame Auth provides a passwordless authentication solution using cryptography, steganography, and biometrics.",
  "how_it_works": "Sesame Auth eliminates the need for passwords by combining cryptographic keys with steganography to embed credentials in images. Users register by providing a username and capturing their typing patterns for account recovery. During authentication, users verify their identity through a random string and biometric authentication, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. User installs the Sesame Auth app and registers by providing a username.",
      "2. The app captures the user's typing pattern for account recovery.",
      "3. User uploads an image that will store their account credentials using steganography.",
      "4. The app generates cryptographic keys and securely stores them on the device.",
      "5. During authentication, the user enters their username and receives a random string for verification.",
      "6. The user enters the random string in the app and completes biometric authentication.",
      "7. The server verifies the input and grants access if it matches."
