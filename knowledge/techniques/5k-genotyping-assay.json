  "how_it_works": "The 5K genotyping assay utilizes genome-wide molecular markers to evaluate genetic diversity and monitor allele inheritance in groundnut varieties. By extracting genomic DNA and amplifying specific regions, high-throughput sequencing generates comprehensive genotyping data. This data enables breeders to make informed decisions early in the selection process, even before visible phenotypic traits manifest.",
