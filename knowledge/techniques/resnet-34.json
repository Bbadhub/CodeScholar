  "one_liner": "ResNet-34 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks.",
  "how_it_works": "ResNet-34 utilizes residual learning to allow gradients to flow through the network more effectively, enabling the training of deeper networks. It consists of 34 layers with skip connections that bypass one or more layers, which helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. This architecture is particularly effective for image classification tasks, such as identifying diseases in plant leaves.",
