  "how_it_works": "This framework analyzes the performance of different DevOps team formations by comparing pre-DevOps and post-DevOps performance metrics. It involves collecting data through surveys from DevOps professionals regarding their team structures and performance outcomes. The analysis identifies which team formations lead to significant improvements in key performance indicators such as lead time and deployment frequency.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Define performance metrics: Lead Time (LT), Deployment Frequency (DF), Mean Time To Repair/Recovery (MTTR), Number of Incidents (NoI), Number of Failures/Service Interruptions (NoF/NoSI).",
      "2. Conduct a survey targeting DevOps professionals to collect data on team structures and performance metrics.",
      "3. Analyze the survey data to compare pre-DevOps and post-DevOps performance values.",
      "4. Calculate the percentage of goal achievement for each performance metric.",
