  "one_liner": "SN-Comparator is a tool for visualizing and comparing the agreement of multiple text embedding models in similarity calculations.",
  "how_it_works": "SN-Comparator constructs similarity networks from various text embedding models to assess their agreement on text similarity. It processes text documents to generate embeddings, builds similarity networks based on these embeddings, and analyzes the networks for model agreement. The results are visualized to help users understand the continuous similarity distribution captured by different models.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Select multiple text embedding models (e.g., USE, BERT, SPECTER).",
      "2. Process the text documents to generate embeddings using the selected models.",
      "3. Construct similarity networks based on the embeddings.",
      "4. Analyze the networks to assess the level of agreement/disagreement between models.",
      "5. Visualize the results using the SN-Comparator tool."
