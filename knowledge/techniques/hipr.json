  "how_it_works": "HIPR identifies security-critical components in a hardware design and replaces them with configurable elements that can only be programmed with a secure bitstream. The process begins by creating a hypergraph representation of the design, which is then analyzed to identify critical logic. Redaction is performed using specialized components, and the configuration bitstream is optimized for size while maintaining security.",
