  "how_it_works": "The FMSF technique involves occluding blood flow in the brachial artery and measuring the fluorescence of NADH in the skin. After inducing ischemia, the changes in fluorescence are recorded to evaluate the ischemic and hyperemic responses. The analysis provides insights into mitochondrial and vascular health by deriving parameters such as flowmotion and hypoxia sensitivity.",

      "4. Record changes in NADH fluorescence during ischemia to determine ischemic response (IRmax).",
      "5. Release the cuff and measure the hyperemic response (HRmax) as NADH fluorescence decreases.",
