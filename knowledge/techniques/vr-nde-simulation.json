  "how_it_works": "Participants engage in a first-person virtual reality simulation that mimics common elements of near-death experiences. The simulation lasts for 11 minutes and is followed by questionnaires assessing changes in death anxiety and perceived stress. The data collected before and after the simulation is analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety and stress levels.",
