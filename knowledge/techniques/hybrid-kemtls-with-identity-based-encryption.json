  "how_it_works": "This technique combines classical public key infrastructure with identity-based encryption to facilitate a gradual transition to post-quantum security. It allows existing TLS certificates to be utilized while integrating post-quantum operations, thereby minimizing the need for immediate updates from certificate authorities. The hybrid approach ensures secure communication by encapsulating keys with both classical and post-quantum methods, maintaining compatibility during the migration process.",
