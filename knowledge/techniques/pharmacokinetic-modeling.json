  "how_it_works": "Pharmacokinetic modeling involves collecting data on drug concentrations in the bloodstream over time after administration. This data is used to calculate key pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax (maximum concentration) and AUC (area under the curve), which help evaluate the bioavailability of different drug formulations. The results inform decisions on optimal dosing strategies and safety assessments in clinical settings.",

      "4. Measure plasma concentrations of the drugs.",
      "5. Calculate pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC) for each formulation.",
