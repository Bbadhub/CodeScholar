  "one_liner": "This technique uses magnetic fields to control the movement of microrobots for targeted drug delivery in complex biological environments.",
  "how_it_works": "Magnetic microrobot navigation involves deploying small robots into the bloodstream and using external magnetic fields to guide them to specific locations, such as blood clots. The microrobots are equipped with sensors that provide feedback for navigating through intricate pathways like cerebral bifurcations. Once at the target site, they can release therapeutic agents, minimizing systemic exposure and enhancing treatment efficacy.",
