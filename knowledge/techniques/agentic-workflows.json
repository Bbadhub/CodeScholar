  "how_it_works": "Agentic Workflows integrate large language models (LLMs) with structured workflows to improve reasoning and reduce inaccuracies in outputs. The process begins with inputting a semantic map and a natural language query into the LLM. An initial response is generated, which is then evaluated and refined through a self-reflection mechanism, allowing for iterative feedback. This approach helps in achieving more accurate object identification and reduces hallucinations in the model's responses.",
