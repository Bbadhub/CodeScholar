  "one_liner": "This technique extracts structured features from financial time series data by analyzing geometric properties of price movements.",
  "how_it_works": "Pattern-Based Feature Extraction focuses on identifying and extracting meaningful geometric patterns from raw financial time series data. By analyzing price movements, the method captures structured features that can enhance the performance of deep learning models. These features help the models learn from significant patterns rather than irrelevant noise, leading to improved classification outcomes.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.",
      "2. Analyze price movements to identify geometric patterns.",

      "4. Feed the extracted features into a deep learning model for classification."
