  "one_liner": "g-C3N4 microrobots are light-responsive devices designed to navigate and degrade antibiotic pollutants in water.",
  "how_it_works": "These microrobots are made from g-C3N4 material and are programmed to respond to light stimuli. They can move against gravitational forces, allowing them to reach targeted areas of antibiotic contamination in water. Once they arrive at the hotspots, they activate their degradation mechanism to clean the water effectively.",
