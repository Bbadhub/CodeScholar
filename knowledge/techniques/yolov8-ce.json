  "how_it_works": "YOLOv8-CE enhances the YOLOv8 architecture by integrating Coordinate Attention to improve localization and using EIoU for better regression accuracy. It processes input images through data augmentation techniques and extracts features using a backbone network. The model employs a decoupled head for classification and detection, and utilizes Focal Loss to effectively handle sample difficulty, particularly for small objects.",

      "4. The neck fuses features at different scales using FPN and PANet.",
      "5. The head uses a decoupled structure for classification and detection.",
      "6. The EIoU loss function is used for regression.",
