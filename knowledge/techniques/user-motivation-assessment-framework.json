  "how_it_works": "The framework involves defining a target demographic and developing a survey to assess user motivations for using chatbots. Data is collected through surveys and interviews, which are then analyzed to identify key factors that influence chatbot adoption. The findings provide insights and recommendations for designing chatbots that better meet user needs.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Define the target demographic (e.g., Gen Z and Gen Alpha).",

      "4. Analyze the data to identify key factors influencing chatbot adoption.",
      "5. Present findings and recommendations for chatbot design."
