  "one_liner": "This technique manipulates AI-generated text to evade detection by text detectors.",
  "how_it_works": "Adversarial techniques are applied to AI-generated text samples to alter their structure and content, making them less recognizable to detection algorithms. The modified texts are then tested against various GenAI text detectors to evaluate how effectively they can identify AI-generated content. The results reveal the impact of these techniques on the reliability of detection systems.",
