  "one_liner": "Dueling DQN is a reinforcement learning technique that improves the stability and efficiency of Q-learning by separating the representation of state value and advantage functions.",
  "how_it_works": "Dueling DQN modifies the standard Q-learning algorithm by introducing two separate streams in the neural network: one for estimating the state value and another for estimating the advantages of each action. This allows the agent to better understand the value of being in a particular state, independent of the actions available. The final Q-value is computed by combining these two streams, which helps in learning more effectively, especially in environments with many actions.",

      "4. Train the Dueling DQN agent using the defined environment.",
      "5. Select actions based on the \u03b5-greedy strategy.",
