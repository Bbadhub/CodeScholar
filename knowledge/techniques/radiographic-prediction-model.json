  "one_liner": "A model that predicts anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients using X-ray images.",
  "how_it_works": "The radiographic prediction model extracts specific features from preoperative X-ray images of KOA patients. It employs LASSO regression to identify significant predictors of ACL function, followed by logistic regression to model the relationship between these predictors and ACL function. The results are visualized through a nomogram, providing a probability of ACL function that aids in clinical decision-making.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect preoperative X-ray images from KOA patients.",
      "2. Extract relevant radiographic features (e.g., wear depth, tibial slope).",
      "3. Apply LASSO regression to select significant predictors.",
      "4. Use logistic regression to model the relationship between predictors and ACL function.",
      "5. Construct a nomogram to visualize the prediction model.",
      "6. Validate the model using ROC analysis and calibration curves."
