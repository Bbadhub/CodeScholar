  "how_it_works": "GExp utilizes an RGB-D camera to observe and understand the environment. It generates scene descriptions to identify objects and employs a large language model (LLM) to create manipulation tasks based on these observations. The robot executes these tasks using a library of skills and verifies their success through both vision-based and code-based methods. Successful tasks are reflected upon to refine the skills library and add new capabilities.",
