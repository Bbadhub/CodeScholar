  "one_liner": "This technique optimizes the labeling process in semantic segmentation by selectively querying high-uncertainty superpixels for manual labeling.",
  "how_it_works": "Dynamic-budget superpixel active learning employs a querying strategy that focuses on selecting superpixels with the highest uncertainty from unlabeled images. It begins with a pool of unlabeled images and iteratively trains a model on labeled data. In each iteration, it identifies superpixels, clusters them based on uncertainty, and labels only those with high uncertainty, thereby optimizing the labeling budget while improving model performance.",
