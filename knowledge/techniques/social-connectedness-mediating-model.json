  "how_it_works": "The model examines survey data from fans to explore how their sense of social connectedness influences their mental health in relation to their fandom identity. By applying statistical analysis, it identifies correlations and uses mediation analysis to quantify the impact of social connections. This helps in understanding the psychological benefits of belonging to a fan community.",
