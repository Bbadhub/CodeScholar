  "one_liner": "PCR is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences for analysis and identification.",
  "how_it_works": "PCR works by repeatedly heating and cooling a mixture of DNA, primers, and polymerase to create copies of a specific DNA segment. The process involves denaturation, annealing, and extension phases, allowing for exponential amplification of the target DNA. This amplified DNA can then be sequenced to identify species or genetic variations.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect mosquitoes using light traps.",
