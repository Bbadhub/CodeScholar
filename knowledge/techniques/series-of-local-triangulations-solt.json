  "how_it_works": "The SOLT algorithm identifies local neighborhoods around points in a point cloud and computes a characteristic length scale for triangulation. It constructs local Delaunay triangulations, refines them to meet the Delaunay criterion, and merges these local triangulations into a global mesh. This process preserves the topology of the original point cloud while avoiding artifacts.",
