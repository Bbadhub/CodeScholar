  "how_it_works": "The Computational Pragmatics Approach focuses on identifying indirect language cues and their associated sentiments within conversational data. It combines linguistic rules with machine learning techniques to extract implicatures from text. By preprocessing the data and applying these rules, the approach classifies sentiments effectively, particularly in contexts like investor communications.",
