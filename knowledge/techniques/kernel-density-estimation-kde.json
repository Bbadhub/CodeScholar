  "one_liner": "KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable.",
  "how_it_works": "KDE uses a set of data points to create a smooth estimate of the probability density function. It applies a kernel function to each data point, which contributes to the overall density estimate. The choice of kernel and the bandwidth parameter significantly influence the smoothness and accuracy of the resulting density estimate.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect atmospheric temperature and geopotential height data.",
      "2. Compute the zero-degree isotherm height (ZDIH) from the data.",
      "3. Calculate daily rain heights using the formula hr = ho + 0.36 (km).",
      "4. Apply KDE using various kernel functions (Gaussian, Epanechnikov, Triangular, Rectangular) to estimate the probability density function of rain heights.",
      "5. Optimize the bandwidth for each kernel to minimize Integrated Squared Errors (ISE).",
      "6. Validate the estimated rain heights against measured data.",
