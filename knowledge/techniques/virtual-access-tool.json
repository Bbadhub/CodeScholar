  "one_liner": "A tool that creates interactive virtual representations of archaeological sites for remote exploration and education.",
  "how_it_works": "The Virtual Access Tool involves collecting data about a physical site, such as Casa Di Diana, and creating a detailed 3D model. Users can interact with this model through a user-friendly interface, allowing them to navigate and explore different areas of the site. Educational content is integrated to enhance the learning experience without compromising the integrity of the physical location.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect data on the physical structure of the site.",
      "2. Create a 3D model based on the collected data.",
      "3. Develop a user interface for interaction with the 3D model.",
      "4. Implement navigation features to explore different areas of the site.",
      "5. Integrate educational content related to the site's history."
