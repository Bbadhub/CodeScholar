  "one_liner": "A lightweight model combining RCBAM for feature extraction and TCN-LSTM for temporal modeling to predict aircraft trajectories.",
  "how_it_works": "This technique employs a teacher-student framework where the RCBAM model extracts high-dimensional spatial features from historical trajectory data. The TCN-LSTM model, acting as the student, learns to predict future trajectory points by leveraging both soft labels from the teacher and hard labels from actual observations. Knowledge distillation is used to enhance the student's performance, making it suitable for real-time trajectory prediction tasks.",
