  "how_it_works": "LightEdit modifies the Stable Diffusion model to reduce computational requirements while maintaining quality. Users provide a base image and a textual prompt that describes the desired edits. The model processes the prompt to identify editing instructions and generates the edited image using a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion. This approach allows for faster and more accessible image editing.",
