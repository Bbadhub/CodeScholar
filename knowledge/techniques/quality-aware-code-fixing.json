  "one_liner": "This technique generates quality-aware code recommendations by analyzing functional and syntactic similarities in code snippets.",
  "how_it_works": "Quality Aware Code Fixing constructs a corpus of annotated code snippets to evaluate their functional and syntactic similarities. It employs clustering techniques to group similar snippets, which helps in generating recommendations that are aware of code quality. The recommendations are then validated against established quality metrics to ensure their effectiveness.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect a corpus of annotated code snippets.",
