  "one_liner": "This technique enables robots to respond to human attention cues, enhancing interaction quality.",
  "how_it_works": "The system captures human gaze direction and pointing gestures using sensors. It processes this sensory input to identify where a human is focusing their attention. The robot then aligns its own focus with the identified focal point and adjusts its actions accordingly to facilitate responsive interaction.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Capture human gaze direction and pointing gestures using sensors.",
      "2. Analyze the captured data to determine the focal point of human attention.",

      "4. Adjust the robot's actions based on the aligned attention."
