  "how_it_works": "Shape Memory Alloys undergo a phase transformation when subjected to specific temperatures, allowing them to return to a predetermined shape. This property is harnessed to create soft actuators that can flex and move in ways similar to biological organisms. By controlling the temperature, these actuators can be activated to perform complex movements, making them suitable for various applications in soft robotics.",
