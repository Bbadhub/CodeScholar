  "one_liner": "Large Language Models are AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on input data.",
  "how_it_works": "LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns in language. They utilize deep learning architectures, often based on transformers, to process and generate text. By analyzing context and semantics, LLMs can produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. They are particularly useful in applications like programming education, where they can assess and provide feedback on coding tasks.",
