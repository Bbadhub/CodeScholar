  "how_it_works": "This technique involves defining a target language variety based on sociolinguistic factors and compiling a training corpus that accurately reflects this variety. The language model is then trained on this corpus, allowing it to learn and predict linguistic patterns specific to the target demographic. Evaluation against benchmarks ensures the model's performance meets desired standards, and adjustments to the corpus can be made to enhance representation.",
