  "one_liner": "This technique identifies video content shared over instant messaging by matching transmission fingerprints against a database.",
  "how_it_works": "The framework captures network traffic from instant messaging software and filters out non-video data. It then extracts unique transmission fingerprints based on the video transmission protocol used. These fingerprints are matched against pre-constructed databases for both ciphertext and plaintext videos to identify the content. The best match provides the identified video content.",

      "4. Match the extracted fingerprints with the video fingerprint database.",
      "5. Identify the video content based on the best match."
