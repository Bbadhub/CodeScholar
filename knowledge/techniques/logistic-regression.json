  "one_liner": "Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes based on one or more predictor variables.",
  "how_it_works": "Logistic regression models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to map predicted values to probabilities, ensuring outputs are between 0 and 1. The model is trained using maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting parameters to best fit the training data. It is particularly useful in scenarios where interpretability of the model is crucial, such as in clinical decision-making.",

      "4. Train the model on the dataset using maximum likelihood estimation.",
      "5. Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and ROC curve.",
      "6. Adjust parameters based on cross-validation results.",
