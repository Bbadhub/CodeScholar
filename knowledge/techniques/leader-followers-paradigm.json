  "one_liner": "A decentralized approach for coordinating multiple UAVs where leaders guide followers in mission execution.",
  "how_it_works": "In the Leader-Followers paradigm, UAVs are organized into leaders and followers to enhance mission efficiency. Leaders are responsible for task allocation and navigation, while followers execute tasks based on the leaders' guidance. This structure allows for autonomous operation and fault tolerance, as followers can adapt to changes in the mission or leader status. Communication among UAVs is crucial for maintaining coordination and ensuring successful mission completion.",
