  "how_it_works": "WPLI quantifies the phase synchronization between different EEG channels, providing insights into functional connectivity in the brain. It is particularly useful for analyzing brain activity in response to emotional stimuli. By comparing the phase differences of signals, WPLI helps identify how different brain regions communicate during specific tasks or emotional experiences.",
