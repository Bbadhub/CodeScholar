  "one_liner": "Neural network pruning reduces the number of active weights in a neural network to create sparser models, optimizing performance metrics.",
  "how_it_works": "Neural network pruning involves applying various strategies to identify and remove less important connections in a neural network. Common methods include Pre-Training, In-Training, Post-Training, and SET, each with distinct mechanisms for pruning. The goal is to maintain model accuracy while reducing size and improving efficiency, particularly for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Initialize the neural network with dense weights.",

      "3. For Pre-Training, calculate L1 norms and prune the weakest connections before training.",
      "4. For In-Training, prune the weakest connections after each epoch and replace them with random connections.",
      "5. For Post-Training, prune the weakest connections after the model has been fully trained.",
      "6. For SET, initialize using the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model and dynamically adjust connections during training.",
      "7. Evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy, inference time, and energy consumption."
