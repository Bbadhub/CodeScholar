  "one_liner": "This technique combines language and vision models to analyze urban sentiment from social media and street view imagery.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique involves two main phases: first, it uses a BERT model to analyze geotagged social media posts for sentiment inference. Next, it employs computer vision models like PSPNet and Mask R-CNN to extract and classify urban design features from corresponding street view images. The results are then integrated to visualize sentiment patterns in relation to urban features.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect geotagged social media posts from platforms like Instagram.",
      "2. Use BERT to analyze captions and extract sentiment scores.",
      "3. Retrieve street view images corresponding to the locations of the posts.",
      "4. Apply PSPNet and Mask R-CNN to segment and classify urban features from the images.",
      "5. Integrate sentiment scores with urban design features.",
      "6. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate relationships between sentiment and urban features."
