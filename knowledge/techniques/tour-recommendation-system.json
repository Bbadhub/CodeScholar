  "how_it_works": "The Tour Recommendation System extracts implicit features from Points of Interest (POIs) using textual descriptions and clusters users based on their visiting sequences. It predicts dynamic staying times at different POIs using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and generates personalized itineraries that maximize user preferences and time constraints. The system leverages social media data to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect photo records with GPS coordinates and timestamps.",
      "2. Assign the nearest POI to each photo record based on GPS location.",
      "3. Extract implicit features from POI textual descriptions using TF-IDF and Autoencoder.",
      "4. Transform visiting sequences into implicit vectors and cluster users using K-Means based on cosine similarity.",
      "5. Evaluate user preferences for each POI based on historical visit data.",
      "6. Predict dynamic staying times for users at different POIs using NMF.",
      "7. Generate the personalized itinerary with the highest preference score and longest remaining time."
