  "how_it_works": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms learn optimal control policies by interacting with the chemical process environment. The agent observes the current state of the process and takes actions based on its policy. It receives feedback in the form of rewards that reflect the effectiveness of its actions, which it uses to update its policy. The process continues until the agent converges on an optimal control strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards while ensuring safety constraints are met.",
