  "one_liner": "This technique uses neuro-fuzzy systems to recognize emotions from audio data and adapt virtual environments accordingly.",
  "how_it_works": "Neuro-fuzzy emotion recognition combines fuzzy logic and neural networks to interpret emotional cues from audio recordings. The process begins with preprocessing the audio to remove noise, followed by segmenting the audio into manageable frames. The neuro-fuzzy system then analyzes these segments to identify emotional states, which are used to dynamically adjust virtual content to enhance user experience.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect raw audio recordings from users.",

      "4. Use a neuro-fuzzy system to analyze the segmented audio for emotional cues.",
      "5. Generate adaptive content based on the recognized emotions.",
