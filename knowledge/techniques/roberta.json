  "one_liner": "RoBERTa is a transformer-based model designed for natural language processing tasks, particularly effective in text classification.",
  "how_it_works": "RoBERTa builds upon the BERT architecture by using a larger training dataset and optimizing the training process. It employs dynamic masking and removes the next sentence prediction objective to enhance its understanding of context. This results in a model that captures semantic nuances and contextual information, making it particularly effective for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect user reviews from Google Play Store and App Store.",
      "2. Preprocess the text data to remove noise and standardize format.",
      "3. Label the data into binary and multi-class categories based on bug presence.",
      "4. Apply the RoBERTa model for classification tasks.",
      "5. Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and various metrics."
