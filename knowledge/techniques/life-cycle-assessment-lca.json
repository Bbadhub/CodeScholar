  "how_it_works": "LCA involves defining the scope of the assessment, collecting data on materials and processes, and calculating the total environmental impacts, particularly carbon emissions. The method aggregates emissions data to provide a comprehensive view of the embodied CO2 associated with a project. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement in sustainability practices.",

      "4. Aggregate the emissions data to obtain total embodied CO2 emissions.",
