  "how_it_works": "LS-YOLO modifies the traditional YOLO architecture to reduce computational load while maintaining detection accuracy. It optimizes the model's structure and parameters, allowing for real-time performance even in adverse environmental conditions. The algorithm processes images, applies non-maximum suppression to filter detections, and outputs bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.",
