  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes the relationship between code smells and design patterns to assess their impact on code quality.",
  "how_it_works": "Co-occurrence analysis involves examining codebases to identify the presence of code smells and design patterns. By cataloging these elements, the technique evaluates how often they appear together and correlates this information with various internal code quality attributes such as maintainability and performance. The results provide insights into how these co-occurrences affect the overall quality of the code.",

      "4. Measure internal code quality attributes (e.g., maintainability, performance).",
      "5. Correlate the co-occurrences with the measured quality attributes.",
