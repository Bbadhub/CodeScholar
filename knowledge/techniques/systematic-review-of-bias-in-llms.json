  "one_liner": "This technique systematically reviews literature to evaluate and address demographic biases in large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique involves defining criteria for including studies that assess demographic biases in LLMs. It conducts a comprehensive literature search, screens relevant studies, and extracts data on bias types and mitigation strategies. The quality of the studies is assessed, and findings are synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of bias in medical LLMs.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Define inclusion criteria for studies evaluating demographic biases in LLMs.",
      "2. Conduct a literature search across multiple databases from January 2018 to July 2024.",
      "3. Screen titles and abstracts for relevance using Rayyan software.",
      "4. Extract data from included studies regarding bias types and mitigation strategies.",
      "5. Assess the quality of studies using JBI Critical Appraisal Tools.",
      "6. Synthesize findings narratively and categorize by bias type and mitigation method."
