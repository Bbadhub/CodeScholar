  "one_liner": "CycleGAN is a generative adversarial network used for image-to-image translation without paired examples.",
  "how_it_works": "CycleGAN consists of two generator networks and two discriminator networks that work together to translate images from one domain to another. It uses adversarial training to ensure that the generated images are realistic while also enforcing cycle consistency to maintain the original content. This allows the model to learn mappings between two different styles or domains without requiring paired training data.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Prepare two datasets: one with limitations and one without.",
      "2. Train two generators (G and F) and two discriminators (DX and DY) simultaneously.",
      "3. Use adversarial losses to train the generators to produce realistic images.",
      "4. Implement cycle consistency loss to ensure that the mapping functions are bijections.",
      "5. Optimize the overall objective function to minimize the loss.",
      "6. Generate transformed images from the source domain to the target domain."
