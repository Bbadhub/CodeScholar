  "one_liner": "This technique classifies types of crime using narrative text extracted from court documents.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique involves extracting narrative sections from public court documents, particularly those containing police report excerpts. After preprocessing the text data, it is labeled according to crime types. A machine learning model is then trained on this labeled dataset to classify new documents based on their narratives.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect public court documents.",
      "2. Extract narrative sections that likely contain police report excerpts.",
      "3. Preprocess the text data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).",
      "4. Label the data based on crime types.",
      "5. Train a machine learning model on the labeled dataset.",
      "6. Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.",
      "7. Use the model for classifying new court documents."
