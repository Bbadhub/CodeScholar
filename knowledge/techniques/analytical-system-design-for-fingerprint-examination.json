  "how_it_works": "This technique involves collecting fingerprint samples from a crime scene and analyzing their condition and clarity. It categorizes prints based on their decay state and relevance, allowing for prioritization of prints for further examination. By matching these prioritized prints against a fingerprint database, the method aims to streamline the identification process, especially in complex environments with overlapping fingerprints.",
