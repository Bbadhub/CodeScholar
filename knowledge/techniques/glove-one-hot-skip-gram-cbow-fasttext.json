  "one_liner": "GloVe is a vector space model for word representation that captures semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence in a corpus.",
  "how_it_works": "GloVe constructs word embeddings by leveraging global word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. It creates a matrix of word co-occurrences and then factorizes this matrix to produce dense vector representations for each word. The resulting vectors capture semantic meanings, allowing for effective comparisons and predictions based on the relationships between words.",
