  "one_liner": "Electroanatomic mapping is a technique used to assess the electrical activity of the heart to diagnose arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.",
  "how_it_works": "Electroanatomic mapping utilizes a multielectrode catheter to collect electrophysiological data from the heart. It identifies areas of low-voltage and fractionated electrograms that indicate myocardial abnormalities. This information helps in diagnosing conditions like arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, particularly when traditional imaging methods are inconclusive.",

      "1. Insert a multielectrode catheter into the heart.",
      "2. Perform endocardial high-density substrate bipolar voltage mapping.",
      "3. Identify areas with low-voltage and fractionated electrograms.",
      "4. Target specific PVC morphologies for ablation.",
