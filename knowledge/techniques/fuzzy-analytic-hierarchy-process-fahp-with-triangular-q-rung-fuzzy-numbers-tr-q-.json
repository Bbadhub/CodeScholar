  "one_liner": "FAHP with TR-q-ROFNS is a method for ranking alternatives based on fuzzy evaluations of subjective criteria.",
  "how_it_works": "FAHP utilizes fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty in decision-making. It employs triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers to represent the fuzziness in pairwise comparisons. The method involves calculating fuzzy weights for each criterion, aggregating these weights, and defuzzifying the results to obtain crisp scores for ranking alternatives.",
