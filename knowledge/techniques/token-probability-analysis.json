  "how_it_works": "This technique involves prompting large language models (LLMs) with specific questions and extracting both the confidence ratings and token probabilities associated with their answers. By comparing these metrics against the actual accuracy of the responses, it assesses how well the token probabilities predict the correctness of the answers. This method is particularly useful in high-stakes fields like medicine, where understanding model confidence is crucial.",
