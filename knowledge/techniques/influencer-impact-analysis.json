  "how_it_works": "Influencer Impact Analysis involves collecting data on influencer endorsements and corresponding market reactions, alongside relevant accounting information. Statistical models are then applied to determine the correlations between these endorsements and investment decisions. The model is validated using historical data to ensure its reliability in predicting market behavior.",
