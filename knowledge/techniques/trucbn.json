  "one_liner": "TruCBN\u2122 is a proprietary formulation of cannabinoids aimed at improving sleep quality through randomized clinical trials.",
  "how_it_works": "TruCBN\u2122 involves a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design to assess the effectiveness of various formulations of cannabinol (CBN) and melatonin on sleep quality. Participants are assigned to different groups receiving either a placebo, melatonin, or varying doses of CBN. Their sleep quality and other health metrics are evaluated through weekly surveys over a six-week period, allowing researchers to analyze the data for significant improvements in sleep and overall well-being.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Recruit participants and obtain informed consent.",
      "2. Randomly assign participants to one of five groups: placebo, 4 mg melatonin, 25 mg CBN, 50 mg CBN, or 100 mg CBN.",
      "3. Instruct participants to take one softgel 1-2 hours before bedtime.",
      "4. Collect baseline health outcome assessments using validated measures.",
      "5. Administer weekly online surveys for six weeks to assess sleep quality and side effects.",
      "6. Analyze data using linear mixed-effects regression models."
