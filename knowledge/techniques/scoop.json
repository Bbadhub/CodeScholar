  "aliases": [],
  "category": "optimization_algorithm",
  "one_liner": "Scoop is an optimization algorithm designed to enhance the training of models for profiling attacks against higher-order masking in cryptographic implementations.",
  "how_it_works": "Scoop leverages second-order derivatives of the loss function to navigate the loss landscape more effectively, which helps in overcoming low-gradient areas that can hinder optimization. It employs sparse mirror descent to utilize the intrinsic sparsity of information present in side-channel attack traces. This combination allows for more efficient training, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods struggle with plateau effects.",
