  "one_liner": "ITPE and ISPE quantify discrepancies between subjective interoceptive beliefs and objective performance in interoception studies.",
  "how_it_works": "This technique assesses interoceptive accuracy through heartbeat tracking and discrimination tasks, combined with self-report questionnaires. ITPE measures the difference between an individual's interoceptive sensibility and their actual accuracy, while ISPE evaluates performance on a trial-by-trial basis along with confidence ratings. The results help in understanding interoceptive processing in various populations, particularly in migraine patients.",

      "4. Calculate ITPE as the difference between interoceptive sensibility and accuracy.",
