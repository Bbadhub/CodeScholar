  "category": "multi-criteria decision analysis, cooperative game theory",
  "one_liner": "This technique prioritizes strategies and allocates resources for tourism development using structured decision-making and game theory.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique combines two methodologies: the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for prioritizing criteria based on stakeholder input, and the Weighted Shapley Value for fairly distributing resources among competing entities. First, AHP is used to evaluate and rank the importance of various criteria related to tourism sites. Then, the Weighted Shapley Value allocates government subsidies based on the contributions of each site to the overall tourism strategy, ensuring that resources are distributed effectively to maximize economic benefits.",
