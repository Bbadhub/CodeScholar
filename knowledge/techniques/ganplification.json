  "one_liner": "GANplification is a technique that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to amplify datasets while preserving their statistical properties.",
  "how_it_works": "GANplification involves training a GAN on a dataset of N events to generate GN synthetic events. The process ensures that the generated data maintains the same probability distribution as the training data by analyzing it through the lens of information theory. This method is particularly useful for creating larger datasets from smaller ones without losing the integrity of the original data.",

      "3. Generate randomized copies of the training data to create a larger dataset.",
      "4. Concatenate G copies to form the final generated dataset."
