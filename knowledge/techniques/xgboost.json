  "one_liner": "XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework designed for speed and performance.",
  "how_it_works": "XGBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner, where each new tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones. It uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss function, which allows it to optimize both the model's accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, it includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Initialize predictions with a constant value.",
      "2. For each boosting round, compute the gradient and hessian of the loss function.",
      "3. Fit a decision tree to the computed gradients.",
      "4. Update the predictions by adding the new tree's predictions scaled by a learning rate.",
      "5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of rounds or until convergence."
