  "how_it_works": "The Physics-informed autoencoder encodes the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars into a latent space that is interpretable. It uses an autoencoder structure where the loss function integrates both reconstruction loss and additional physics-informed losses. This allows the model to learn the mapping between observables and microphysical parameters while adhering to physical laws, ensuring that the results are meaningful and interpretable in the context of astrophysics.",

      "4. Train the model using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and apply early stopping.",
