  "one_liner": "The Improved Walrus Optimizer enhances clustering through opposition-based learning and mutation strategies.",
  "how_it_works": "IWO begins by initializing a population of candidate solutions for clustering. It generates opposition solutions for each candidate to evaluate their performance against mirrored counterparts, enhancing exploration. The better solution is retained in the population, while a mutation strategy introduces controlled randomness to maintain diversity and avoid premature convergence. This process continues until the convergence criteria are met.",
