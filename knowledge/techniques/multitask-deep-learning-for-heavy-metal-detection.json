  "one_liner": "This technique uses multitask deep learning to simultaneously detect multiple heavy metal contaminants in soil using spectroscopy data.",
  "how_it_works": "Multitask deep learning leverages a single model to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously. In this case, it processes visible and near-infrared spectroscopy data to identify levels of various heavy metals like manganese, chromium, and cobalt. The model is trained on labeled data and can generalize to new, unseen data, making it effective for large-scale contamination mapping.",

      "1. Collect visible and near-infrared spectroscopy data from soil samples.",

      "4. Train the model using labeled data for manganese, chromium, and cobalt.",
      "5. Validate the model using a separate dataset.",
      "6. Apply the trained model to new data to predict contamination levels.",
