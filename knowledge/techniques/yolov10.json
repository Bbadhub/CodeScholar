  "one_liner": "YOLOv10 is a real-time object detection model designed for high accuracy and speed in identifying objects in images.",
  "how_it_works": "YOLOv10 processes images through a single neural network that divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. It uses transfer learning to adapt to specific datasets, allowing it to detect and classify objects efficiently. The model is particularly effective for real-time applications, making it suitable for scenarios like wildlife monitoring.",
