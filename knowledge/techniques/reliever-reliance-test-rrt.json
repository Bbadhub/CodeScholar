  "one_liner": "The RRT evaluates patients' reliance on short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and provides personalized feedback to improve asthma management.",
  "how_it_works": "The RRT uses the SABA Reliance Questionnaire (SRQ) to assess how much patients depend on SABA for asthma control. Patients complete the questionnaire online, which consists of five items scored on a Likert scale. Based on their responses, the tool classifies their risk of over-reliance on SABA and offers tailored feedback and recommendations to encourage better asthma management discussions with healthcare professionals.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Patient completes the RRT online.",
      "2. Calculate the SRQ score based on responses to 5 items.",
      "3. Classify the risk of SABA over-reliance as low, medium, or high based on the SRQ score.",
      "4. Provide personalized feedback and recommendations based on the risk classification.",
      "5. Encourage patients to discuss their treatment with healthcare professionals."
