  "one_liner": "This technique assesses the presence of microplastics in fish and evaluates their health using specific indices.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique involves collecting fish samples and dissecting specific organs to isolate microplastics using potassium hydroxide. After filtering and identifying the microplastics, health indices are calculated based on the fish's biometric data and microplastic content. Statistical analyses are then performed to understand the relationships between microplastic presence and fish health.",

      "4. Filter the digested samples through a fine mesh filter.",
      "5. Identify and categorize microplastics based on size, shape, and color.",
      "6. Calculate health indices (K, HSI, GILSI, GITI) using the specified formulas.",
