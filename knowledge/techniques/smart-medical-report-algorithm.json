  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes blood test results to efficiently detect both common and rare diseases using machine learning.",
  "how_it_works": "The Smart Medical Report Algorithm processes blood test data to identify patterns linked to various diseases. It employs a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest classifier, to learn from historical data with known outcomes. After training, the model can predict potential diseases from new test results and generate a comprehensive diagnostic report.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect blood test data from patients.",
      "2. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize features.",
      "3. Train the classification model using labeled data of known disease outcomes.",
      "4. Validate the model using a separate test dataset.",
      "5. Apply the trained model to new blood test results to predict potential diseases.",
      "6. Generate a report summarizing the findings."
