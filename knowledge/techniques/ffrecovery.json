  "one_liner": "FFRecovery enables selective recovery of files from ransomware attacks using file system forensics and flash memory data extraction.",
  "how_it_works": "FFRecovery first detects ransomware and halts its execution to prevent further damage. It identifies which files need recovery based on user input and then uses forensic analysis to restore the file system metadata. The original file data is extracted from the flash memory, and the logical disk locations are remapped to the physical locations. Finally, the metadata and data are assembled to restore the files to their original state.",

      "5. Re-map the logical disk locations to the physical flash memory locations.",
