  "one_liner": "Fermentation techniques enhance the nutritional quality of low-grade poultry feed ingredients through microbial action.",
  "how_it_works": "Fermentation employs microbial inoculants to enzymatically break down complex macromolecules in feed ingredients, improving their digestibility and nutrient availability. Depending on the moisture content of the substrates, either solid-state or liquid-state fermentation methods are utilized. The process involves controlling various parameters such as temperature and pH to optimize the fermentation outcome.",

      "4. Control fermentation parameters (temperature, pH, duration).",
