  "one_liner": "This technique reduces the size of test suites while maintaining code coverage using unsupervised machine learning methods.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique begins by gathering all test cases and analyzing their code coverage data. It then applies unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster similar test cases, which helps identify redundant or less effective tests. By evaluating the impact of each cluster on overall coverage, it selects representative tests to form a reduced test suite that still meets coverage requirements.",
