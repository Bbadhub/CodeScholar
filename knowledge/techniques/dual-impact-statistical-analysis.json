  "how_it_works": "Dual Impact Statistical Analysis separates the effects of AI on emissions into two categories: reductions and increases. By analyzing these effects independently, it provides a clearer picture of AI's overall environmental impact. The method utilizes statistical techniques to quantify these impacts based on collected data, leading to more informed policy and technology assessments.",
