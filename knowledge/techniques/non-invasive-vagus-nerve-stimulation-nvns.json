  "one_liner": "nVNS is a therapeutic technique that stimulates the vagus nerve to alleviate symptoms in patients with persistent post-concussion syndrome.",
  "how_it_works": "nVNS employs a handheld device to stimulate the vagus nerve non-invasively, activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Patients use the device daily, applying it to the cervical pulse point for short sessions. The effectiveness of the treatment is evaluated through changes in symptom severity measured by the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI).",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Patient completes baseline NSI assessment.",
      "2. Patient is prescribed gammaCore\u2122 device for nVNS.",
      "3. Patient is trained to use the device over the cervical pulse point.",
      "4. Patient uses the device for 2 minutes, twice in the morning and twice in the evening.",
      "5. Follow-up NSI assessment is conducted approximately 112 days post-treatment initiation.",
      "6. Analyze changes in NSI scores to evaluate treatment efficacy."
