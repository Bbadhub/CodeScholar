  "how_it_works": "Human-in-the-loop transfer learning combines traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine the model's decision-making capabilities. Initially, a reinforcement learning model is trained on simulated scenarios. Human feedback is collected on potential actions, which is then incorporated into the training dataset. This iterative process allows the model to align its actions more closely with human preferences, particularly in dynamic environments where obstacles may vary.",
