  "aliases": [],

  "one_liner": "This technique predicts short-term currency movements by integrating quantitative market data with qualitative news sentiment using attention mechanisms.",
  "how_it_works": "The model combines quantitative data, such as price and volume, with qualitative data from news sentiment. It preprocesses both data types to ensure compatibility and applies sentiment analysis to extract meaningful insights from news headlines. Attention mechanisms are then utilized to dynamically weigh the importance of different inputs, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features during training and prediction.",
