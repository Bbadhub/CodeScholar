  "one_liner": "This algorithm optimizes multi-objective task scheduling using principles inspired by student psychology and non-dominated sorting.",
  "how_it_works": "The algorithm begins by initializing a population of potential task schedules. Each schedule is evaluated based on multiple objectives, and non-dominated sorting is used to rank these schedules. Inspired by student psychology, the algorithm updates the solutions to improve them iteratively. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, resulting in optimized task schedules for satellite operations.",
