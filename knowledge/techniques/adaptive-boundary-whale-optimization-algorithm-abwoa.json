  "one_liner": "ABWOA enhances the Whale Optimization Algorithm by dynamically adjusting search boundaries for improved optimization in high-dimensional problems.",
  "how_it_works": "ABWOA starts with a population of potential solutions and evaluates their fitness based on resource requirements. It updates the positions of these solutions using various mechanisms to explore the search space effectively. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the search boundaries based on the current optimal solutions, ensuring that the search remains focused and efficient. This process continues until the convergence criteria are met, resulting in an optimized mapping of physical network entities to digital twin nodes.",
