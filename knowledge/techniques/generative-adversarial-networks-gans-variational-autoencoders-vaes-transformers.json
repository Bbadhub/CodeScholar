  "one_liner": "Generative models that create new data instances similar to a given dataset.",
  "how_it_works": "GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other to produce realistic data. VAEs, on the other hand, encode input data into a latent space and then decode it back to generate new instances. Together, they can be used to simulate complex scenarios, such as wildfire spread, by learning from multimodal geospatial data.",
