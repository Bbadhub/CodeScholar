  "how_it_works": "CLaSP utilizes a dataset of crystal structures paired with publication titles and abstracts to create embeddings that capture the relationships between materials and their properties. It employs a contrastive learning framework to align these crystal and text embeddings, allowing for intuitive retrieval of materials based on textual queries. The model is pre-trained on crystal structures and fine-tuned with keywords from literature to enhance its performance in material discovery.",
