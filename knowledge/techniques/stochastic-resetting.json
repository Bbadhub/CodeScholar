  "one_liner": "Stochastic Resetting enhances SGD by allowing model parameters to reset to a previous state, mitigating the effects of label noise during training.",
  "how_it_works": "Stochastic Resetting integrates a mechanism into the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) process where model parameters can revert to a checkpoint with a certain probability. This approach helps avoid overfitting to corrupted data by revisiting earlier, potentially more accurate states of the model. By doing so, it improves generalization performance, especially in the presence of label noise in the training dataset.",
