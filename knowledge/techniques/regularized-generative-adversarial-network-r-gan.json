  "how_it_works": "R-GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator that creates synthetic anomaly data and a discriminator that evaluates the authenticity of this data against real training data. The regularization component ensures that the generated anomalies are diverse and representative of real-world scenarios. The generator and discriminator are trained iteratively, with the generator improving based on feedback from the discriminator until convergence is achieved.",
