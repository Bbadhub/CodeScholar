  "how_it_works": "Network analysis constructs a graphical representation of symptoms as nodes and their relationships as edges. By collecting longitudinal data, it visualizes how these relationships evolve over time. Centrality measures are calculated to identify core symptoms, providing insights into their significance and changes across assessments.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect longitudinal data on symptoms using a standardized scale.",
      "2. Construct a Gaussian graphical model for each time point to visualize symptom relationships.",

      "4. Perform network comparison tests across different time points to analyze changes in symptom relationships."
