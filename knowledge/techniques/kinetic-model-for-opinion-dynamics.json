  "one_liner": "This technique models the evolution of opinions in social networks using a kinetic approach based on agent interactions.",
  "how_it_works": "The kinetic model simulates how individual opinions change over time through interactions among agents in a social network. Each agent has a defined opinion and follower count, influencing how they interact with others. By analyzing real-world data from platforms like Twitter, the model calibrates parameters to reflect actual opinion distributions, capturing phenomena such as consensus and polarization.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Define agents with two values: number of followers and opinion.",
      "2. Establish interaction rules based on follower count and opinion distance.",
      "3. Derive the kinetic equation for opinion evolution.",
      "4. Use sentiment analysis to score opinions from Twitter data.",
      "5. Calibrate interaction kernels using parameter estimation techniques."
