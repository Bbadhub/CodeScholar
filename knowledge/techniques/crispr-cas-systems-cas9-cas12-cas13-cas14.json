  "one_liner": "CRISPR-Cas systems are used for precise gene editing to modify specific genes in organisms, including bacteria, to combat antibiotic resistance.",
  "how_it_works": "CRISPR-Cas systems utilize a guide RNA (gRNA) to target specific genes associated with antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Once the gRNA directs the Cas protein to the target gene, a double-strand break is induced. The bacterial cell's natural repair mechanisms are then exploited to introduce modifications that disrupt the resistance gene, potentially restoring susceptibility to antibiotics.",
