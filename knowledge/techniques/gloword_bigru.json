  "one_liner": "GloWord_biGRU enhances sentiment classification by combining GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings processed through a bidirectional GRU.",
  "how_it_works": "GloWord_biGRU utilizes two popular word embedding techniques, GloVe and Word2Vec, to create richer representations of words. These embeddings capture both local and global context, which are then fed into a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (biGRU) to analyze the sequential nature of text data. The output of the biGRU is pooled and passed through dense layers to classify the sentiment of the text.",
