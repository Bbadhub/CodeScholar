  "one_liner": "A tool for intercepting and analyzing system calls made by applications in Linux containers.",
  "how_it_works": "The System Call Analyzer uses ptrace and eBPF to intercept system calls from applications running in Linux containers. It initializes a detector that communicates with the kernel to monitor these calls. The intercepted data is filtered and analyzed based on predefined criteria, and the results are sent to a server for processing and storage, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Initialize the detector and set up eBPF for system call interception.",
      "2. Launch the target container using Podman.",
      "3. Monitor system calls made by the container using ptrace or eBPF.",
      "4. Filter and analyze the intercepted system calls based on predefined criteria.",
      "5. Send the analyzed data to the server for processing.",
      "6. Store the results in a database for further analysis.",
      "7. Provide a web interface for users to interact with the system."
