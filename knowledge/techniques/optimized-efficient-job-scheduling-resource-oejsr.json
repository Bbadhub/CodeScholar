  "how_it_works": "OEJSR combines the Cuckoo Search Optimization algorithm with Grey Wolf Optimization to enhance job scheduling. It starts by initializing a population of potential solutions and evaluates their fitness based on resource allocation. The best solutions are refined using Grey Wolf Optimization, and less fit solutions are replaced with new ones generated by Cuckoo Search. This iterative process continues until a convergence criterion is met, resulting in an optimized job scheduling plan.",
