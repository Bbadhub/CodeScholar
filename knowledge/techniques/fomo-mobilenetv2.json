  "how_it_works": "FOMO employs a MobileNetV2 neural network to classify images of objects captured by a camera. The system processes these images to identify shapes such as spherical, rectangular, or cylindrical. It then correlates the identified shapes with myographic signals to determine the appropriate grip type for a bionic hand prosthesis, enabling real-time interaction with the environment.",
