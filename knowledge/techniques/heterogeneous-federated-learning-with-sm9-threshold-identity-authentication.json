  "one_liner": "This technique enables secure and privacy-preserving collaborative model training across diverse healthcare institutions.",
  "how_it_works": "Heterogeneous Federated Learning allows multiple healthcare institutions to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. Each institution trains its own model using its medical data and sends the model parameters to a central server for aggregation. The SM9 threshold identity authentication ensures that only authorized participants can contribute, maintaining data privacy throughout the process.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Each healthcare institution trains its local model using its medical data.",
      "2. Local models are sent to the parameter server (PS) for aggregation.",
      "3. The PS performs global aggregation using a model alignment algorithm.",
      "4. The aggregated model is sent back to the institutions for further local training.",
      "5. The SM9 threshold signature algorithm is used to authenticate participants and secure data transmission.",
      "6. Repeat the process for multiple training rounds."
