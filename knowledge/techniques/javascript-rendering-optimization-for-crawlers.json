  "one_liner": "This technique optimizes the rendering of JavaScript-heavy web pages for efficient vulnerability scanning by selectively rendering necessary components.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique analyzes the JavaScript execution paths of a web page to identify which elements are essential for vulnerability scanning. By creating a rendering plan that includes only these critical elements, it minimizes resource consumption. This selective rendering leads to faster scans and reduced server costs, making it particularly useful for dynamic websites.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Identify the target web page and its JavaScript dependencies.",
      "2. Analyze the JavaScript execution to determine which elements are critical for vulnerability scanning.",
      "3. Create a rendering plan that includes only the necessary elements.",
      "4. Execute the rendering plan to fetch the required DOM elements.",
      "5. Perform vulnerability scans on the rendered elements.",
      "6. Log results and optimize future rendering decisions based on past scans."
