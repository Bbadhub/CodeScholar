  "how_it_works": "Mofka separates event data into metadata and payloads, optimizing the transfer of each component. It utilizes Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for high-speed data transfers, making it suitable for handling large scientific payloads. The system supports batching of metadata and allows consumers to selectively retrieve data, enhancing efficiency in high-performance computing environments.",

      "1. Producer creates a topic with a validator, partition selector, and serializer.",

      "4. Consumer subscribes to partitions and receives metadata batches.",
      "5. Consumer uses a data selector to specify which data parts to retrieve.",
