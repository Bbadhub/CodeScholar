  "one_liner": "This technique enhances climate models by integrating non-traditional datasets with modern data.",
  "how_it_works": "Non-traditional data integration involves gathering unconventional datasets, such as historical records, art, and oral histories, to enrich climate science. The process begins with digitizing and standardizing these datasets for analysis. The integrated data is then cross-verified with existing climate models to identify patterns that can improve predictive accuracy.",
