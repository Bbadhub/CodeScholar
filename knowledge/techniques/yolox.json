  "one_liner": "YOLOx is a one-stage object detection model that predicts bounding boxes and classifications in a single pass, optimized for speed and efficiency.",
  "how_it_works": "YOLOx utilizes a backbone network called CSPDarkNet to extract features from input video frames. It aggregates space-time features from consecutive frames to enhance detection accuracy. The model predicts bounding boxes and class labels in one pass, allowing for fast inference speeds. Additionally, it reuses results from previous frames to improve detection performance in video streams.",
