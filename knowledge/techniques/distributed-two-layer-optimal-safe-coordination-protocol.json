  "one_liner": "A protocol for coordinating swarms of hypersonic flight vehicles while ensuring safety and optimality.",
  "how_it_works": "This technique employs a two-layer protocol consisting of a decision layer and a control layer. The decision layer utilizes a distributed projection optimization algorithm to keep outputs within a predefined safety set. Meanwhile, the control layer implements a safety controller that uses feedback linearization to adjust control inputs. This structure allows for optimal output convergence while adhering to safety constraints throughout the operation.",
