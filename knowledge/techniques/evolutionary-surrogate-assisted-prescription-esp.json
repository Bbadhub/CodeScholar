  "how_it_works": "ESP begins by collecting historical land-use data and training a surrogate model to predict emissions based on this data. It then initializes a population of candidate land-use policies represented as neural networks. Each candidate is evaluated using the surrogate model, and the best-performing candidates are selected for further evolution through crossover and mutation. This iterative process continues until a set of optimal policies is identified, represented as a Pareto front balancing emissions and land-use change.",
