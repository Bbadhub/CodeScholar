  "how_it_works": "Mass Spectrometry Imaging combines mass spectrometry with imaging to analyze the spatial distribution of metabolites in samples, such as herbal medicines. The technique allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis without complex sample preparation. By slicing the sample into thin sections and applying an ionization method, ions are generated and analyzed to create detailed images of metabolite distribution and concentration.",

      "1. Prepare the sample by slicing it into thin sections.",

      "4. Analyze the ions using a mass analyzer to obtain mass spectra.",
      "5. Map the spatial distribution of the detected ions to create an image.",
