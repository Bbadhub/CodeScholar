  "how_it_works": "RT-MQTT allows applications to specify real-time requirements for MQTT messages, which are enforced by a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller. The framework intercepts MQTT traffic to extract these requirements and creates network reservations to ensure low latency and reliable communication. Multicast is utilized to efficiently propagate MQTT messages across multiple edge networks, optimizing performance in industrial scenarios.",
