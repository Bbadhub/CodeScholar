  "one_liner": "This technique trains robots to optimally apply force while wrapping paper around various objects.",
  "how_it_works": "The technique involves collecting data on manual wrapping to understand the forces applied. A model is trained to predict the required force based on the size and material of the object being wrapped. During the wrapping process, a control system adjusts the force in real-time, ensuring optimal wrapping without damaging the material.",
