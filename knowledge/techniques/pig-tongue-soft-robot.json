  "how_it_works": "The method begins with 3D scanning a pig tongue to analyze its intrinsic muscle structure. A 3D model is then created from the scans, which is used to fabricate a soft robot using silicone materials. McKibben artificial muscles are embedded within the silicone to replicate the muscle movements and stiffness of a real tongue, allowing for flexible and dynamic motion.",
