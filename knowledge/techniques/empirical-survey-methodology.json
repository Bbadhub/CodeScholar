  "one_liner": "A method for collecting and analyzing survey data to understand relationships between variables.",
  "how_it_works": "This methodology involves designing a survey to gather data on specific behaviors and their associated outcomes. Participants respond to questions that quantify their experiences, which are then statistically analyzed to identify patterns and correlations. The results provide insights into how certain behaviors impact various aspects of life, such as relationships and well-being.",

      "4. Perform statistical analysis to identify correlations between phone use and relationship outcomes.",
