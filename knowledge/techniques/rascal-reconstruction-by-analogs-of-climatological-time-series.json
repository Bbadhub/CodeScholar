It preprocesses observational and reanalysis data, selects relevant predictor variables, and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. By finding and averaging the most relevant analog days, it reconstructs the target climatological time series, potentially applying bias reduction techniques for improved accuracy.",
