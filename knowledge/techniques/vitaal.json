  "how_it_works": "ViTAAl utilizes a two-step approach that first builds an audio-only Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to derive temporal alignments from acoustic features. These alignments are then used to train a visual HMM, which processes visual features extracted from video. This method improves the convergence and feature extraction of the visual system without increasing model complexity, making it suitable for low-resource scenarios.",
