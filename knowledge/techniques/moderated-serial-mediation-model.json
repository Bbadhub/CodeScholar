  "one_liner": "This technique analyzes the relationships between variables while accounting for mediation and moderation effects.",
  "how_it_works": "The Moderated Serial Mediation Model examines how one variable influences another through a mediator, while also considering the impact of a moderator. In this context, it assesses the effects of benevolent sexism on women's career growth by measuring self-esteem and emotional exhaustion as mediators. The model uses statistical tools to analyze data collected over time, allowing for a nuanced understanding of these relationships.",
  "algorithm": {
    "steps": [
      "1. Collect data from female employees across various industries using a three-wave survey.",
      "2. Measure benevolent sexism, self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and career growth at different time points.",
      "3. Analyze the data using statistical software to test the relationships and mediation effects.",
      "4. Apply bootstrapping techniques to assess the significance of mediation.",
      "5. Evaluate the moderating effects of career development strategies."
