  "one_liner": "This technique models vehicle behavior to ensure smooth acceleration while maintaining safe distances in autonomous driving.",
  "how_it_works": "The Dynamic Car-Following Model uses real-time data to measure the headway time between vehicles. It calculates the desired speed and acceleration based on this headway, applying a jerk suppression mechanism to minimize abrupt changes in acceleration. This results in smoother driving experiences while ensuring that the following vehicle maintains a safe distance from the leading vehicle.",

      "4. Adjust the following vehicle's speed to maintain the desired headway.",
