  "one_liner": "This technique involves training separate models for embryo-ranking and implantation-prediction to enhance accuracy in IVF applications.",
  "how_it_works": "Decoupled Learning for IVF separates the tasks of embryo-ranking and implantation-prediction into distinct models. This approach prevents conflicting objectives that can arise when using a single model, thereby reducing shortcut learning bias. By focusing on each task independently, the models can be optimized for their specific objectives, leading to improved performance in both areas.",
