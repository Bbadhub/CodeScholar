  "one_liner": "A systematic approach to measure and rate the durability of garments based on key influencing variables.",
  "how_it_works": "The Durability Rating Framework identifies critical variables that affect garment durability, such as fabric type and stitching quality. It involves designing controlled experiments to test these variables and collecting performance data. This data is then analyzed to generate a standardized durability rating system, providing an objective measure of garment quality.",

    "steps": [
      "Identify key durability variables (e.g., fabric type, stitching quality).",
