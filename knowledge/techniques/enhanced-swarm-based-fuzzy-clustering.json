  "how_it_works": "Enhanced Swarm-based Fuzzy Clustering employs swarm intelligence to optimize the clustering of pixels in monochromatic images. It begins by initializing swarm agents that explore the feature space for optimal clustering positions. Each agent's fitness is evaluated based on the quality of clustering, and their positions are updated accordingly. The technique incorporates a cluster recognition strategy to improve segmentation accuracy, iterating until convergence criteria are met.",
