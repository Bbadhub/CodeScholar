  "how_it_works": "Super-resolution models like SRCNN, EDSR, VDSR, and ESPCN take low-resolution images as input and apply deep learning techniques to reconstruct higher-resolution versions. These models learn to predict pixel values based on the patterns in the training data. The output images are then evaluated for their readability and decoding success, especially in the context of QR codes.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Input the low-resolution QR code image.",
      "2. Preprocess the image (if necessary) to fit model input requirements.",
      "3. Pass the image through the selected super-resolution model (EDSR, VDSR, ESPCN, or SRCNN).",
      "4. Obtain the enhanced image output.",
      "5. Decode the enhanced QR code using a QR code detection library.",
