It uses the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) as a measure of model quality, iteratively refining the feature subsets through probabilistic transitions. By allowing the acceptance of worse solutions, it helps escape local minima, ultimately converging on the best subset of features that enhances model performance.",
