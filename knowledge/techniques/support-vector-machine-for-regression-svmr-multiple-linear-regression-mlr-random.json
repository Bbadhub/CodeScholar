  "one_liner": "SVMR is a regression technique that predicts continuous outcomes based on input features using support vector machines.",
  "how_it_works": "SVMR works by finding the hyperplane that best fits the data points in a high-dimensional space. It aims to minimize the error while maximizing the margin between the predicted values and actual outcomes. The model is trained on historical data to learn the relationship between input features and the target variable, allowing it to make accurate predictions on unseen data.",

    "steps": [
      "1. Collect historical data from battery sensors during charge/discharge cycles.",
      "2. Preprocess the data (cleaning, scaling, feature extraction).",
      "3. Train the SVMR model using the preprocessed data.",
      "4. Predict the number of cycles elapsed and remaining capacity.",
      "5. Calculate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on the predicted cycles and fault threshold."
