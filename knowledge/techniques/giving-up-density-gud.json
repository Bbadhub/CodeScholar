  "how_it_works": "The GUD technique involves setting up foraging stations in areas with and without livestock guardian dogs. By measuring the amount of food left at these stations over time, researchers can calculate the GUD, which reflects the effort predators are willing to expend to obtain food. A higher GUD indicates that predators are less willing to forage in the presence of guardian dogs, suggesting a landscape of fear created by these animals.",
