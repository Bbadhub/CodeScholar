  "one_liner": "This technique enhances SAT solver performance by partitioning problems and clustering features using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM).",
  "how_it_works": "The technique begins by analyzing a SAT problem and partitioning it into smaller, manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then processed to extract relevant features, which are clustered using a Self-Organizing Map. This clustering helps identify patterns that optimize the search strategy of the SAT solver, allowing for more efficient problem-solving. Finally, the results from the subproblems are combined to produce the final solution or proof of unsatisfiability.",
