# Problem: Signal Processing

Signal processing involves the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals to extract useful information. This is particularly important in applications such as sensor data analysis, where real-time processing and efficient resource usage are critical.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with real-time sensor data.
- You have limited computational resources.
- You need to preserve both detailed and overall trends in your data.
- You are using energy-harvesting IoT devices.
- You require efficient data processing methods.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Wavelet-based edge computing method, as it effectively handles real-time data with limited resources while maintaining accuracy.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Wavelet-based edge computing method** | medium | low | high | medium | You need to process real-time sensor data efficiently without sacrificing detail. |

## Approaches

### Wavelet-based edge computing method

**Best for:** When you need to analyze sensor data in real-time with limited computational resources while preserving detailed trends.

**Tradeoff:** This method balances the need for detailed analysis with the constraints of limited computational power.
