# Problem: Binary Image Classification

Binary image classification involves categorizing images into one of two classes. This is commonly used in applications such as medical imaging, where distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy images is crucial.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with images that need to be classified into two categories.
- You have a dataset of labeled images for training.
- You require high accuracy in your classification results.
- You are dealing with a time-sensitive project where training time is a concern.
- You are considering using pre-trained models to improve performance.

## Start Here

**Start with DenseNet if you are looking for a balance between accuracy and implementation complexity, especially in medical image classification tasks.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **DenseNet** | medium | high | high | medium | You have access to a good dataset and need to achieve high accuracy quickly. |

## Approaches

### DenseNet

**Best for:** when you need to classify medical images for pneumonia detection or similar tasks.

**Tradeoff:** DenseNet provides high accuracy but may require more computational resources.
