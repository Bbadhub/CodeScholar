# Problem: Confidence Estimation in Natural Language Processing

Confidence estimation in NLP involves assessing how certain a model is about its predictions. This is particularly important in applications where incorrect outputs can have significant consequences, such as in healthcare or legal domains.

## You Have This Problem If

- Your model's predictions are critical for decision-making.
- You need to evaluate the reliability of language models.
- You are working on applications that require user trust in AI outputs.
- You are developing systems that interact with sensitive data.
- You have observed inconsistent performance in your NLP models.
