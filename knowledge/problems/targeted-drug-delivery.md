# Problem: Targeted Drug Delivery

Targeted drug delivery involves directing therapeutic agents to specific sites within the body to enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects. This approach is particularly important in treating diseases like cancer and neurological disorders, where precision is crucial.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are developing a system to deliver drugs to specific tissues or organs.
- You are facing challenges with the precision of drug delivery mechanisms.
- You are working on minimizing side effects of drug treatments.
- You are integrating robotics or advanced technologies in medical applications.
- You are exploring innovative solutions for drug delivery in complex biological environments.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is Magnetic Microrobot Navigation, as it provides a high level of accuracy in targeted drug delivery, especially in challenging environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Magnetic Microrobot Navigation** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to navigate through complex biological environments to deliver drugs accurately. |

## Approaches

### Magnetic Microrobot Navigation
