# Problem: Behavior Change Intervention for Asthma Management

This problem involves developing strategies to change patient behaviors related to asthma management, particularly focusing on reducing reliance on short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs). Effective interventions can help patients understand their condition better and manage it more effectively.

## You Have This Problem If

- Patients frequently use their rescue inhalers (SABAs) for symptom relief.
- Patients report feeling anxious about their asthma symptoms.
- Healthcare providers notice a lack of adherence to preventive asthma medications.
- Patients express confusion about their asthma management plan.
- There is a high number of emergency room visits related to asthma exacerbations.

## Start Here

**The Reliever Reliance Test (RRT) is recommended as the first approach for addressing high reliance on SABAs, as it provides a structured framework for patient education and engagement.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Reliever Reliance Test (RRT)** | medium | low | high | medium | Patients are over-relying on rescue inhalers and need structured education on asthma management. |

## Approaches

### Reliever Reliance Test (RRT)

**Best for:** When patients exhibit high reliance on SABA for asthma management and require education on the risks of overuse.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require significant patient engagement but can lead to better long-term management of asthma.
