# Problem: Biodiversity Monitoring

Biodiversity monitoring involves assessing the variety and abundance of species in a given ecosystem. It is crucial for conservation efforts and understanding ecological health, especially in the face of environmental changes.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to assess species diversity in a specific area.
- Traditional biodiversity assessment methods are too invasive or impractical.
- You require quick results on species presence.
- You are working with vertebrate species.
- You have access to PCR technology.

## Start Here

**Start with PCR for biodiversity monitoring, as it allows for rapid and non-invasive assessment of vertebrate diversity, making it suitable for urgent conservation needs.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)** | fast | medium | medium | medium | You need a quick and non-invasive method to assess vertebrate species presence. |

## Approaches

### PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

**Best for:** when you need to monitor vertebrate diversity in a non-invasive manner.

**Tradeoff:** While PCR is rapid and non-invasive, it may not provide a complete picture of biodiversity.
