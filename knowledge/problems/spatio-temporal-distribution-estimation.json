  "problem_name": "Spatio-Temporal Distribution Estimation",
  "description": "Spatio-temporal distribution estimation involves predicting how a phenomenon varies across both space and time. This is particularly important in fields like meteorology, urban planning, and environmental science, where understanding the distribution of variables can inform decision-making.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You need to analyze data that varies over time and location.",
    "You are dealing with environmental data such as rainfall or temperature.",
    "You require insights into how certain phenomena change seasonally.",
    "You are working with datasets that have spatial and temporal components."
