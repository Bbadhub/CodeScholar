  "description": "Data clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. This is commonly used in data analysis to identify patterns and structures within datasets.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You have a dataset that needs to be categorized into distinct groups.",
    "You notice that traditional methods are yielding suboptimal clusters.",
    "You are facing challenges with local optima in your clustering results.",
    "You require a method that balances exploration and exploitation in clustering.",
    "You need a solution that adapts well to different types of data distributions."
