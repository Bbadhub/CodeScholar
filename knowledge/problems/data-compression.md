# Problem: Data Compression

Data compression is the process of reducing the size of a dataset to save storage space or transmission time. It involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation, which can be crucial for efficient data management and transfer.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with large datasets that take up significant storage space.
- You need to transmit data over bandwidth-limited networks.
- You require faster data processing times without sacrificing quality.
- You are working with various types of data that may need different compression strategies.
- You have constraints on storage or transmission costs.

## Start Here

**Start with the COMPROMISE technique as it provides a balanced approach for compressing diverse datasets while maintaining quality, making it suitable for most scenarios.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **COMPROMISE** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a flexible compression solution that can adapt to varying data characteristics and user-defined error thresholds. |

## Approaches

### COMPROMISE

**Best for:** when you need to compress large datasets efficiently without significant loss of quality.

**Tradeoff:** This approach offers flexibility in handling heterogeneous data types but may require more computational resources.
