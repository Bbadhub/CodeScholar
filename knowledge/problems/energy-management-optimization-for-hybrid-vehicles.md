# Problem: Energy Management Optimization for Hybrid Vehicles

Energy management optimization in hybrid vehicles involves determining the most efficient way to allocate energy resources between different power sources, such as electric and gasoline engines. This optimization is crucial for enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions while maintaining vehicle performance.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are developing a hybrid vehicle or powertrain system.
- You need to improve fuel efficiency in a vehicle.
- You are evaluating different energy consumption strategies.
- You are facing challenges in managing energy flow between multiple power sources.
- You are looking for ways to optimize vehicle performance while minimizing energy waste.

## Start Here

**Start with Dynamic Programming as it provides a structured approach to optimize energy management in hybrid vehicles, especially when evaluating multiple strategies.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
