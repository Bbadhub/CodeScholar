# Problem: Energy Efficiency Optimization in High-Performance Computing

Energy efficiency optimization in high-performance computing (HPC) focuses on minimizing energy consumption while maintaining performance levels. This is crucial for reducing operational costs and meeting regulatory requirements in data centers.

## You Have This Problem If

- You notice high energy bills from your HPC systems.
- You are facing pressure to comply with energy efficiency regulations.
- Your data center is looking to implement sustainable practices.
- You experience thermal management issues due to high power usage.
- You are looking for ways to optimize resource allocation in your HPC workloads.

## Start Here

**Start with energy-aware scheduling and dynamic power management, as it directly addresses the need for energy efficiency while maintaining performance in HPC systems.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Energy-aware scheduling and dynamic power management** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to balance performance with energy savings in HPC environments. |

## Approaches

### Energy-aware scheduling and dynamic power management

**Best for:** when you need to reduce operational costs in HPC systems and comply with energy efficiency regulations.
