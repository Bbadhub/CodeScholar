# Problem: Network Security and Optimization

Network security and optimization involves ensuring that data transmitted across networks is secure while also maximizing the efficiency and performance of the network. This problem is critical for organizations that rely on networked systems for their operations, especially in the context of modern technologies like IoT and SCADA.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing frequent security breaches in your network.
- Your network performance is suboptimal, leading to slow data transmission.
- You are managing a large number of devices that require secure connections.
- You need to modernize an outdated network infrastructure.
- You are facing challenges in IP address management across your network.
