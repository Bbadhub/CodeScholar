# Problem: Spatial Optimization for Crime Prevention

Spatial optimization for crime prevention involves strategically placing resources, such as surveillance cameras, to maximize safety and deter criminal activity. This problem is crucial for urban planners, law enforcement, and community safety initiatives.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are tasked with improving safety in a specific area.
- You need to allocate limited resources effectively.
- You are analyzing crime patterns and hotspots.
- You are involved in urban planning or public safety initiatives.

## Start Here

**The Optimal Camera Placement Algorithm is the recommended first approach for most cases, as it effectively balances coverage and resource allocation in urban environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Optimal Camera Placement Algorithm** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to ensure maximum coverage and deterrence in a defined area. |

## Approaches

### Optimal Camera Placement Algorithm

**Best for:** Designing surveillance systems for urban areas and assessing security needs for large public events.

**Tradeoff:** While this algorithm provides optimal placements, it may require significant computational resources.
