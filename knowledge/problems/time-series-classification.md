# Problem: Time Series Classification

Time series classification involves categorizing sequences of data points collected over time. This problem is common in various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring, where understanding patterns over time is crucial for making predictions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have sequential data that varies over time.
- You need to identify patterns or trends in the data.
- You are facing challenges with noise in your data.
- You require accurate predictions based on historical data.
- You have tried basic models but need more structured features.

## Start Here

**Start with Pattern-Based Feature Extraction as it effectively addresses noise and enhances the performance of classification models in financial time series.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Pattern-Based Feature Extraction** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have noisy financial time series data and need to extract meaningful features for classification. |

## Approaches

### Pattern-Based Feature Extraction

**Best for:** when you need to classify financial time series data with high noise levels and existing models are underperforming.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require more preprocessing but can significantly improve model performance.
