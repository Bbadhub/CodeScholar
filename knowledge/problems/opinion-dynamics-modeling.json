  "description": "Opinion dynamics modeling involves understanding how opinions spread and evolve within a population, particularly in social networks. This problem is crucial for analyzing social behaviors, political polarization, and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at influencing public opinion.",

    "You are analyzing how opinions change over time in a group.",
    "You need to understand the influence of social media on public sentiment.",
    "You are designing strategies to sway public opinion.",
    "You are studying the dynamics of consensus and conflict in social groups."
