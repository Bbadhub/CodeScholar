  "problem_name": "Cognitive Style Influence on Information Processing in Multimodal Environments",
  "description": "This problem involves understanding how different cognitive styles affect the way individuals process information presented through various modalities, such as visual, auditory, and tactile. It is particularly relevant in designing environments like museums or educational settings that aim to cater to diverse user needs.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You notice that users are struggling to engage with multimodal content.",
    "Feedback indicates that certain cognitive styles are not being effectively addressed.",
    "There is a significant variation in user interaction patterns with the content.",
    "You are conducting research on user experience in complex information environments.",
    "You are designing an exhibition or educational program that targets a diverse audience."
