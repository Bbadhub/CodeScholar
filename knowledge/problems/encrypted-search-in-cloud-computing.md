# Problem: Encrypted Search in Cloud Computing

Encrypted search in cloud computing refers to the challenge of performing search operations on data that is stored in an encrypted format. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality while still allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are storing sensitive data in the cloud.
- You need to perform searches on this encrypted data.
- Data confidentiality is a top priority.
- You require high recall in your search results.
- You want to support multi-keyword searches.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Hybrid Encrypted Search Framework, as it effectively addresses the need for secure searches while maintaining high recall on sensitive data.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Hybrid Encrypted Search Framework** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to perform secure multi-keyword searches on sensitive data without compromising recall. |

## Approaches
