# Problem: Offline Programming of Industrial Robots

Offline programming of industrial robots involves creating and testing robot programs without the need for the physical robot to be present. This allows engineers to optimize robot operations and troubleshoot issues in a simulated environment before actual deployment.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to program an industrial robot for a specific task.
- You want to simulate robot operations before implementation.
- You are designing a robotic cell with multiple components.
- You are facing challenges with real-time programming.
- You want to reduce downtime during robot setup.
