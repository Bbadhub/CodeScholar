# Problem: Program Synthesis

Program synthesis is the process of automatically generating programs from high-level specifications. It aims to create software that meets certain requirements without the need for manual coding.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to generate code based on specific input-output examples.
- You are facing challenges in manually coding complex logic.
- You require automated solutions for repetitive programming tasks.
- You want to optimize existing code or algorithms.
- You are exploring new programming paradigms or languages.

## Start Here

**Start with Imperative Genetic Programming as it allows for the exploration of complex program generation without needing prior structural knowledge, making it suitable for a variety of synthesis tasks.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Imperative Genetic Programming** | medium | high | medium | medium | You need to evolve programs that optimize logic without predefined structures. |

## Approaches

### Imperative Genetic Programming

**Best for:** when you need to evolve complex imperative programs without prior knowledge of their structure.

**Tradeoff:** This approach can generate innovative solutions but may require significant computational resources.
