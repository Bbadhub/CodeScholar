  "problem_name": "Error Metric Evaluation for Regression Models",
  "description": "Evaluating the performance of regression models can be challenging, especially when traditional metrics do not adequately capture the model's effectiveness in predicting extreme values. This problem is particularly relevant in fields like environmental science, where accurate predictions of rare but impactful events are crucial.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are working with regression models that need to predict extreme outcomes.",
    "Traditional error metrics like MSE or RMSE do not reflect model performance adequately.",
    "Your application is sensitive to the accuracy of predictions in the tails of the distribution.",
    "You are involved in projects related to environmental modeling or other critical applications.",
    "You have observed significant discrepancies in model performance during extreme events."
