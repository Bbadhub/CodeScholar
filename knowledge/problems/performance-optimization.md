# Problem: Performance Optimization

Performance optimization involves enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of a system, process, or individual to achieve better results. This can apply to various fields, including software engineering, athletics, and health management.

## You Have This Problem If

- You notice slow response times in your application.
- Users report lag or delays during critical operations.
- Performance metrics indicate resource bottlenecks.
- You are unable to meet performance benchmarks or SLAs.
- Your application struggles under high load conditions.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Sleep Extension Protocol, as it provides a structured method to enhance performance through sleep management, which is often overlooked.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Sleep Extension Protocol** | medium | low | high | medium | You are developing health applications focused on sleep tracking and optimization. |

## Approaches

### Sleep Extension Protocol

**Best for:** When designing interventions to enhance athletic performance through sleep management.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require significant lifestyle changes but can lead to substantial performance improvements.
