# Problem: Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming for Logistics Optimization

This problem involves optimizing logistics operations where decisions include both continuous and discrete variables, such as quantities of products to transport and routes to take. It is particularly challenging due to the non-linear relationships between variables and the need to satisfy various constraints.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are trying to minimize transportation costs while considering multiple products.
- You have complex constraints related to delivery times and capacities.
- You need to make decisions that include both integer (e.g., number of trucks) and continuous (e.g., amount of goods) variables.
- You are facing difficulties in finding optimal solutions using linear programming methods.
- You require a solution that balances cost, time, and resource allocation.

## Start Here

**Start with Quadratically Constrained Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (QC-MINLP) as it is specifically designed to handle the complexities of logistics optimization with both integer and continuous variables.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |

| **Quadratically Constrained Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (QC-MINLP)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have a complex logistics problem with multiple products and constraints that cannot be simplified to linear relationships. |

## Approaches

### Quadratically Constrained Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (QC-MINLP)

**Best for:** when you need to optimize distribution logistics for multiple products with complex constraints.

**Tradeoff:** This method can provide more accurate solutions but may require significantly more computational resources.
