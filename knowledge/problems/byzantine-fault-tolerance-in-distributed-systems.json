  "problem_name": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems",
  "description": "Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is a property of a distributed system that allows it to continue functioning correctly even when some of its nodes fail or act maliciously. This is crucial for maintaining reliability and trust in decentralized applications, especially in environments where nodes may not fully trust each other.",

    "You are working on a decentralized application.",
    "Your system requires consensus among nodes with varying trust levels.",
