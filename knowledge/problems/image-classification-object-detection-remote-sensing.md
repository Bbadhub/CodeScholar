# Problem: Image Classification and Object Detection in Remote Sensing

This problem involves identifying and classifying objects within images captured from remote sensing technologies. It is crucial for applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with large datasets of satellite or aerial images.
- You need to detect and classify multiple objects in real-time.
- You require high accuracy in identifying features from images.
- Your project involves cloud-based image processing solutions.
- You are facing challenges with traditional image analysis methods.

## Start Here

**Start with YOLOv5 for image classification and object detection in remote sensing, as it balances speed and accuracy effectively for large datasets.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **YOLOv5** | fast | medium | high | medium | You need to process and analyze large volumes of images quickly while maintaining high accuracy. |

## Approaches

### YOLOv5

**Best for:** When you need to analyze large volumes of astronomical image data or require real-time detection in remote sensing applications.

**Tradeoff:** YOLOv5 offers high speed and accuracy but may require significant computational resources.
