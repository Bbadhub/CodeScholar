# Problem: Symptom Management in Traumatic Brain Injury

Symptom management in traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves addressing the ongoing effects of brain injuries, particularly in patients experiencing persistent symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Effective management is crucial for improving the quality of life and facilitating recovery.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are treating patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms.
- Patients report ongoing headaches, dizziness, or cognitive difficulties.
- You are looking for non-pharmacological treatment options.
- Standard care protocols have not provided sufficient relief.
- You are integrating adjunctive therapies into existing treatment plans.

## Start Here

**Begin with Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) as it offers a promising non-pharmacological approach for managing persistent symptoms in TBI patients.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS)** | medium | low | medium | medium | You need a non-pharmacological intervention for patients with persistent symptoms after mTBI. |

## Approaches

### Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS)

**Best for:** Managing persistent post-concussion symptoms in patients with mTBI.

**Tradeoff:** While nVNS is non-invasive and offers a novel approach, its effectiveness and acceptance in clinical practice are still being evaluated.
