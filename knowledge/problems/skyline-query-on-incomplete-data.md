# Problem: Skyline Query on Incomplete Data

Skyline queries are used to identify a set of optimal points in a dataset based on multiple criteria. When dealing with incomplete data, traditional methods may fail to provide accurate results, necessitating specialized techniques to handle missing values effectively.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with large datasets that contain significant missing values.
- You need to perform skyline queries for data mining applications.
- You are optimizing query performance in geographic information systems.
- You notice that standard skyline query methods are yielding incomplete or inaccurate results.
- You require a solution that balances performance and accuracy in the presence of missing data.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is the Incomplete Data Weighted Classification Tree, as it specifically addresses the challenges of skyline queries in the presence of incomplete data while providing a balance between performance and accuracy.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Incomplete Data Weighted Classification Tree** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have a large dataset with missing values and need to perform skyline queries efficiently. |

## Approaches

### Incomplete Data Weighted Classification Tree

**Best for:** Handling large datasets with significant missing values while performing skyline queries.

**Tradeoff:** Balances the need for accuracy in skyline queries with the challenges posed by incomplete data.
