# Problem: Fault Injection Evaluation

Fault injection evaluation involves testing systems to determine their resilience against faults or attacks that can disrupt normal operations. This is particularly important in security-sensitive applications, such as cryptographic hardware, where vulnerabilities can lead to significant breaches.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with cryptographic hardware designs.
- You need to assess the security of your system against fault injection attacks.
- You require a framework that accommodates different adversary models.
- You are conducting pre-fabrication security assessments.
- You are looking for a structured approach to evaluate hardware implementations.
