# Problem: Sparse Matrix Storage Optimization

Sparse matrix storage optimization involves finding efficient ways to store matrices that contain a large number of zero elements. This is crucial in applications like machine learning where memory usage and performance can be significantly impacted by the choice of storage format.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with large datasets that include sparse matrices.
- Your application is experiencing memory constraints.
- You notice performance issues related to matrix operations.
- You require dynamic adjustments to storage formats during runtime.
- Your machine learning model heavily relies on sparse data.
