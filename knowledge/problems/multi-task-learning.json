    "You are working on a model that needs to perform well on several related tasks.",
    "You notice that your model is overfitting to one task while neglecting others.",
    "You are trying to optimize performance across different but related objectives.",
    "You are facing difficulties in balancing the trade-offs between tasks.",
    "You require a model that can adapt to new tasks without retraining from scratch."
