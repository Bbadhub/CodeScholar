# Problem: Object-Centered Planning

Object-centered planning involves organizing and managing tasks around specific objects in a system, particularly in robotics. This approach is crucial for improving the efficiency and accuracy of robotic operations, especially when dealing with complex environments and tasks.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on a robotic system that requires precise object identification.
- Your application involves complex queries related to object functions.
- You are experiencing issues with hallucinations in outputs from language models used in robotic tasks.
- You need to enhance the reasoning capabilities of your robotic system.
- Your project involves multiple interacting objects that require coordinated planning.
