# Problem: Spatial Metabolomics in Analytical Chemistry

Spatial metabolomics involves the study of the spatial distribution of metabolites within biological samples. This is crucial for understanding the biochemical processes and interactions in complex samples like herbal medicines.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to analyze the distribution of metabolites in a sample.
- You are working with herbal medicines or complex biological matrices.
- You require high-resolution imaging of metabolites.
- You are interested in quality control of herbal products.
- You are exploring pharmacological mechanisms of compounds.

## Start Here

**Start with Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) for visualizing metabolite distributions, as it provides high accuracy and is well-suited for herbal medicine analysis.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need detailed spatial analysis of metabolites in complex samples. |

## Approaches

### Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI)

**Best for:** when you need to visualize the spatial distribution of metabolites in herbal medicines.

**Tradeoff:** MSI provides detailed spatial information but may require complex sample preparation.
