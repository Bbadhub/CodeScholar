# Problem: Feature Selection for Supervised Learning Classification

Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. This is crucial in supervised learning classification tasks to improve model performance and reduce overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with high-dimensional datasets.
- Your model is overfitting or underperforming.
- You notice long training times for your classification models.
- You are using traditional feature selection methods that are not scalable.
- You want to improve model accuracy while reducing computational costs.

## Start Here

**Start with the Enhanced Binary Kepler Optimization Algorithm (BKOA-MUT) as it is specifically designed for high-dimensional feature selection and can significantly improve model performance.**
