# Problem: Microservices Design

Microservices design involves creating a software architecture that consists of small, independent services that communicate over a network. This approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in software development.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are building a new application that requires modular components.
- Your existing monolithic application needs to be refactored into smaller services.
- You are facing challenges in scaling your application efficiently.
- You need to improve deployment frequency and reduce time to market.
- Your team is struggling with service identification and decomposition.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is to explore AI-driven tools for microservices design, as they can significantly streamline the design process and improve architectural validation.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **AI-driven tools for microservices design** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to automate service identification and decomposition in a complex domain. |

## Approaches

### AI-driven tools for microservices design

**Best for:** Designing new microservices from scratch in complex domains.

**Tradeoff:** While AI-driven tools can automate and enhance design processes, they may require initial setup and learning time.
