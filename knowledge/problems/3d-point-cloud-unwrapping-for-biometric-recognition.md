# Problem: 3D Point Cloud Unwrapping for Biometric Recognition

This problem involves transforming 3D point cloud data into a 2D representation for biometric recognition, such as fingerprint identification. The challenge lies in accurately unwrapping complex shapes while preserving essential features for recognition purposes.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with 3D point cloud data from biometric scanners.
- You need to accurately model complex shapes for recognition.
- You are developing a biometric system for fingerprint recognition.
- You encounter difficulties in processing and analyzing 3D data.
- You require a method that maintains the integrity of the original data.
