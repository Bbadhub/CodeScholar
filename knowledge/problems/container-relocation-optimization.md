# Problem: Container Relocation Optimization

Container relocation optimization involves determining the most efficient way to move containers within a storage area, such as a port or warehouse. The goal is to minimize costs and time while maximizing space utilization and operational efficiency.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing delays in container retrieval.
- Your operational costs for container handling are increasing.
- You have a high volume of containers to manage.
- You are facing challenges in logistics and supply chain efficiency.
- Your current methods are leading to suboptimal space utilization.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is the Three-Stage Heuristic (3SH) due to its effectiveness in handling high volumes of containers while balancing cost and efficiency.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Three-Stage Heuristic (3SH)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to optimize container movements in a busy terminal with limited resources. |

## Approaches

### Three-Stage Heuristic (3SH)

**Best for:** Optimizing container retrieval in maritime terminals with high container volumes.

**Tradeoff:** Provides a good balance between solution quality and computational efficiency.
