  "problem_name": "Hallucination Mitigation in Natural Language Processing",
  "description": "Hallucination in natural language processing refers to the generation of incorrect or nonsensical information by language models. This issue can lead to significant errors, especially in applications requiring high accuracy and reliability.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "Your language model generates outputs that contain factual inaccuracies.",
    "The generated text includes information that is not present in the input data.",
    "You are working with low-resource languages and need to ensure high accuracy.",
    "Your application domain is sensitive to errors, such as healthcare or legal.",
    "You notice inconsistencies in the model's responses across similar queries."
