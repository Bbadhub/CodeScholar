    "You have a large number of test cases that take a long time to execute.",
    "You notice that many tests are redundant or provide little additional value.",
    "You are facing challenges in maintaining test cases for legacy code.",
    "You want to improve the efficiency of your testing process without sacrificing quality.",
    "You are looking for ways to optimize resource usage in your CI/CD pipeline."
