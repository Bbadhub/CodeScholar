# Problem: Facility Location Optimization

Facility location optimization involves determining the most effective locations for facilities to minimize costs and maximize service efficiency. This problem is crucial in various fields, including logistics, urban planning, and resource allocation.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to minimize transportation costs.
- You want to maximize service coverage for customers.
- You are dealing with multiple potential facility sites.
- You have constraints such as budget or space limitations.
- You are looking to improve operational efficiency in a network.

## Start Here

**Start with the UAV Fog Node Location algorithm, as it is specifically designed for optimizing resource allocation in environments where latency is critical.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
