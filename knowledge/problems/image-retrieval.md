# Problem: Image Retrieval

Image retrieval is the process of searching and retrieving images from a large database based on specific queries or features. This problem often arises in applications such as digital asset management, surveillance, and content-based image retrieval systems.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to find specific images based on visual content.
- You are dealing with large datasets of images.
- You require high accuracy in retrieving relevant images.
- You are facing challenges with image quality or data privacy.
- You need to enhance or anonymize images for ethical compliance.

## Start Here

**Start with CycleGAN if you are working with sensitive images that require anonymization or if you want to improve the quality of your training data for better retrieval performance.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **CycleGAN** | medium | high | high | medium | You need to enhance image quality while ensuring ethical standards in data usage. |

## Approaches

### CycleGAN

**Best for:** When you need to anonymize datasets containing identifiable human features or improve training data quality.

**Tradeoff:** CycleGAN is effective for data anonymization but may require significant computational resources.
