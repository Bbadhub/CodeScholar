# Problem: Autonomous Exploration and Skill Acquisition

This problem involves enabling robots to explore unknown environments and acquire skills through their experiences. The goal is to create systems that can adapt and learn without requiring human intervention.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with robots that need to operate in unfamiliar settings.
- You want the robot to generate its own tasks based on what it observes.
- You require a system that can adapt to different scenarios autonomously.
- You are facing challenges in programming robots for dynamic environments.
- You need to improve the efficiency of robots in learning new skills.

## Start Here

**Start with GExp as it provides a robust framework for autonomous exploration and skill acquisition, allowing for adaptability in unknown environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **GExp** | medium | high | high | medium | You need a flexible solution for robots to learn and adapt in real-time. |

## Approaches

### GExp

**Best for:** when you need a robot to autonomously explore and learn in an unknown environment.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require significant computational resources but offers high adaptability.
