  "problem_name": "Component Network Meta-Analysis",
  "description": "Component network meta-analysis (CNMA) is a statistical method used to evaluate the effects of multiple treatments that may be combined in various ways. It helps researchers understand how different components of interventions contribute to overall treatment effects, especially in complex scenarios.",

    "You are dealing with multicomponent treatment data.",
    "You need to assess the individual contributions of various treatment comparisons.",
    "You are looking for a method to improve the interpretability of your meta-analysis results.",
    "Your data includes complex interventions with overlapping treatment components.",
    "You require a robust statistical approach to analyze treatment effects."
