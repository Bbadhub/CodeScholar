# Problem: Real-time Monitoring and Management of Underwater Cultural Heritage

This problem involves the need to continuously monitor and manage underwater cultural heritage sites to protect them from environmental changes and human activities. It requires real-time data collection and analysis to ensure the preservation of submerged artifacts and sites.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are responsible for managing underwater cultural heritage sites.
- You need to monitor environmental conditions affecting submerged artifacts.
- You have limited or intermittent cloud connectivity in maritime areas.
- You are deploying sensor networks in remote underwater locations.
- You require real-time risk assessment capabilities for heritage sites.
