# Problem: Cloud Cost Optimization

Cloud cost optimization involves managing and reducing expenses associated with cloud services while maintaining performance and availability. It is crucial for organizations to ensure they are not overspending on cloud resources, especially in large-scale or multi-cloud environments.

## You Have This Problem If

- You notice unexpected spikes in your cloud bills.
- Your cloud usage is growing rapidly and becoming difficult to manage.
- You are using multiple cloud providers and need to optimize costs across them.
- You lack visibility into your cloud spending patterns.
- You want to implement a systematic approach to predict future cloud costs.

## Start Here

**Start with Graph-based Cost Optimization as it provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling cloud costs, especially in complex environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Graph-based Cost Optimization** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a structured way to analyze and optimize costs across multiple cloud services. |

## Approaches

### Graph-based Cost Optimization

**Best for:** when you need to manage costs for a large-scale cloud application or in a multi-cloud environment.

**Tradeoff:** This approach provides a systematic method for cost prediction but may require significant initial setup.
