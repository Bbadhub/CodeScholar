# Problem: Distributed Optimal Control

Distributed optimal control involves coordinating multiple agents or systems to achieve a common goal while optimizing performance and ensuring safety. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where systems operate in dynamic environments and require real-time decision-making.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with multiple autonomous agents.
- Your system requires real-time coordination.
- Safety is a critical concern in your application.
- You are dealing with high-speed or dynamic environments.
- You need to optimize performance across distributed systems.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Distributed two-layer optimal safe coordination protocol, as it effectively balances safety and coordination in high-speed applications.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Distributed two-layer optimal safe coordination protocol** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to ensure safety while coordinating multiple agents in a dynamic environment. |

## Approaches

### Distributed two-layer optimal safe coordination protocol

**Best for:** Designing control systems for swarms of hypersonic vehicles and ensuring safety in high-speed aerospace applications.

**Tradeoff:** This approach prioritizes safety and coordination but may introduce complexity in implementation.
