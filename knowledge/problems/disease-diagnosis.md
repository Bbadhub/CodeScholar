# Problem: Disease Diagnosis

Disease diagnosis involves identifying a disease based on various symptoms, test results, and other relevant data. It is crucial in both medical and agricultural fields to ensure timely and accurate treatment or intervention.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are trying to identify a specific disease based on symptoms or test results.
- You have access to multiple data sources (e.g., images, lab results).
- You need to improve the accuracy of existing diagnostic methods.
- You are working under time constraints for diagnosis.
- You are integrating diagnostic capabilities into an application.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Smart Medical Report Algorithm, especially if you are focused on speed and integrating into healthcare applications.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Multimodal Fusion Framework** | medium | high | high | hard | You have high-quality images and multiple data sources for plant disease diagnosis. |
| **Smart Medical Report Algorithm** | fast | medium | medium | medium | You need quick diagnosis from blood tests in a clinical setting. |

## Approaches

### Multimodal Fusion Framework

**Best for:** when you need to diagnose plant diseases accurately using multiple data sources.

**Tradeoff:** Offers high accuracy but may require extensive data preprocessing.
