  "problem_name": "Multimodal Imaging",
  "description": "Multimodal imaging refers to the integration of multiple imaging techniques to obtain complementary information about a subject, often used in medical diagnostics. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of imaging by combining different modalities, such as PET, MRI, and CT, to provide a more comprehensive view of the biological processes.",
