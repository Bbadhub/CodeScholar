# Problem: Cross-Domain Voice Conversion

Cross-domain voice conversion involves transforming audio from one domain (like singing) to another (like speech) while preserving the speaker's identity. This is particularly useful in applications such as music technology and improving accessibility for hearing-impaired users.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on projects that involve audio processing.
- You need to convert singing into intelligible speech.
- You are developing applications for music technology.
- You are focused on enhancing audio intelligibility for specific user groups.
- You are interested in improving Automatic Lyrics Transcription systems.
