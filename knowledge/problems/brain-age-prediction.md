# Problem: Brain Age Prediction

Brain age prediction involves estimating the biological age of a person's brain based on various factors such as neuroimaging data and lifestyle choices. This can help in understanding cognitive decline and the impact of different occupational and lifestyle factors on brain health.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are analyzing neuroimaging data.
- You want to correlate lifestyle factors with cognitive health.
- You are developing tools for health monitoring.
- You need to assess occupational impacts on brain health.

## Start Here

**Start with brain age prediction algorithms as they provide a structured approach to analyzing neuroimaging data and understanding cognitive health.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
