# Problem: Vulnerability Detection

Vulnerability detection involves identifying security flaws in software code that could be exploited by attackers. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of applications, especially in large and complex codebases.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with large codebases, such as Python or smart contracts.
- Existing vulnerability detection tools are failing to identify complex vulnerabilities.
- You need a solution that can leverage machine learning techniques.
- You require a lightweight solution that can run on lower-performance hardware.
- You are facing challenges in analyzing the structure of your code effectively.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is to use the Block-Level Conformer for its high accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities in large Python codebases, especially when existing tools are inadequate.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Block-Level Conformer** | medium | high | high | medium | You are dealing with large Python projects and need robust vulnerability detection. |
| **Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN)** | fast | low | medium | easy | You are working with smart contracts and need a lightweight solution. |

## Approaches

### Block-Level Conformer

**Best for:** when you need to detect vulnerabilities in large Python codebases and existing tools are inadequate.

**Tradeoff:** Offers advanced detection capabilities but may require significant computational resources.
