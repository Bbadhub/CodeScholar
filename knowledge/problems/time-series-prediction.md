# Problem: Time Series Prediction

Time series prediction involves forecasting future values based on previously observed values over time. This problem is common in various fields, including finance, weather forecasting, and resource management.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have sequential data that changes over time.
- You need to make predictions based on historical trends.
- You are dealing with time-dependent variables.
- Your data exhibits seasonality or cyclic patterns.
- You require forecasts for planning and decision-making.

## Start Here

**Start with the CNN-LSTM approach if you are dealing with critical infrastructure predictions, as it effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **CNN-LSTM** | medium | high | high | medium | You have a large dataset with complex temporal patterns and need high accuracy in predictions. |

## Approaches

### CNN-LSTM

**Best for:** when you need to predict time series data for critical infrastructure or crisis management solutions.

**Tradeoff:** While CNN-LSTM can capture complex patterns, it may require significant computational resources.
