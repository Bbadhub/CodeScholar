# Problem: Multi-Objective Task Scheduling

Multi-objective task scheduling involves optimizing the allocation of tasks to resources while considering multiple conflicting objectives. This problem is common in various domains, such as satellite operations and project management, where trade-offs between objectives must be carefully managed.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to allocate multiple tasks to limited resources.
- You are facing conflicting objectives in task prioritization.
- You require efficient scheduling under resource constraints.
- You are working on optimization problems in a dynamic environment.
