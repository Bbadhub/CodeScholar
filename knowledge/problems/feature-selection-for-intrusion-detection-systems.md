# Problem: Feature Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems

Feature selection for intrusion detection systems involves identifying the most relevant features from a dataset to improve the performance of the system. This process is crucial for enhancing detection accuracy while minimizing computational costs, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## You Have This Problem If

- Your intrusion detection system is underperforming.
- You are working with a large volume of network traffic data.
- You notice high computational costs during feature processing.
- You want to reduce the number of features without losing significant information.
- You are looking for a method to balance accuracy and efficiency.
