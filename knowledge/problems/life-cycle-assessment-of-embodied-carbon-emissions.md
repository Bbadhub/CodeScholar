# Problem: Life-Cycle Assessment of Embodied Carbon Emissions

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a method used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction to disposal. In the context of embodied carbon emissions, LCA helps in understanding the total greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are involved in urban planning or construction projects.
- You need to evaluate the sustainability of building materials.
- You are required to report on carbon emissions for compliance.
- You are interested in reducing the carbon footprint of a project.
- You are assessing the environmental impact of design choices.

## Start Here

**Start with Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) as it provides a detailed analysis of embodied carbon emissions and is essential for sustainable design practices.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a thorough evaluation of the environmental impacts of a product or building over its entire lifecycle. |

## Approaches

### Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)

**Best for:** when assessing the environmental impact of new urban developments or sustainable building practices.

**Tradeoff:** LCA provides comprehensive insights but can be resource-intensive.
