# Problem: Cancer Progression Modeling

Cancer progression modeling involves understanding how cancer develops and progresses over time. This can help in developing targeted therapies and understanding the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are studying the mechanisms of cancer development.
- You need to evaluate the effectiveness of new cancer therapies.
- You are investigating the relationship between cancer and other diseases.
- You require a model to simulate tumor growth and progression.
- You are focused on specific proteins or genetic factors influencing cancer.

## Start Here

**The TG3 Snca knockout mouse model is recommended as the first approach for studying cancer progression due to its ability to simulate specific genetic alterations relevant to tumor growth.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **TG3 Snca knockout mouse model** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a reliable model to study specific genetic factors in cancer progression. |

## Approaches

### TG3 Snca knockout mouse model

**Best for:** Developing therapies targeting DNA damage response in melanoma and studying specific proteins in tumor growth.

**Tradeoff:** This approach provides a controlled experimental model but may not fully replicate human cancer complexity.
