  "problem_name": "Retrial Queues in Queueing Theory",
  "description": "Retrial queues are a type of queueing model where customers who find all servers busy leave the system and return later to try again. This is particularly relevant in scenarios like call centers or telecommunication systems where customers may retry their requests after a certain period.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are experiencing high retry rates from users.",
    "Your system has fluctuating server availability.",
    "You need to model customer behavior in a telephony system.",
    "You are designing a call center with proactive follow-up strategies."
