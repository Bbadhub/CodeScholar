# Problem: Parameter Estimation in Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Parameter estimation in molecular dynamics simulations involves determining the optimal parameters that govern the behavior of molecular systems. Accurate parameter estimation is crucial for simulating realistic molecular interactions and predicting properties of materials or biological systems.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing discrepancies between simulated and experimental results.
- Your simulations are sensitive to the choice of parameters.
- You need to quantify the uncertainty in your simulation outcomes.
- You are working with complex systems, such as water or biomolecules.
- You require a method to systematically improve the accuracy of your simulations.
