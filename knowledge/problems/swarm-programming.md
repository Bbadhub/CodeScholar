# Problem: Swarm Programming

Swarm programming involves the collaboration of multiple agents or programmers to solve problems collectively. It is inspired by the behavior of social organisms and aims to leverage the collective intelligence of a group to enhance problem-solving capabilities.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on decentralized systems.
- Your project involves multiple interacting agents.
- You need to implement complex behaviors like flocking.
- Your application requires resilience to changes in the environment.
