  "description": "Hybrid cyberattacks involve multiple attack vectors, such as false data injection and direct load-altering attacks, targeting systems like smart grids. Defending against these attacks requires advanced techniques that can adapt to both the dynamic nature of the threats and the decentralized nature of the systems being protected.",

    "You are managing a smart grid with distributed energy resources.",
