# Problem: Neurofeedback Intervention

Neurofeedback interventions aim to modify brain activity through real-time feedback, often used in treating various psychological and neurological conditions. This approach can help individuals learn to regulate their brain function, potentially improving symptoms related to addiction, anxiety, and other disorders.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on interventions for addiction treatment.
- You are researching brain stimulation techniques.
- You are exploring reward processing in addiction.
- You have access to neurostimulation equipment.
- You are interested in non-invasive brain modulation methods.

## Start Here

**Start with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as it provides a focused method for brain modulation in addiction treatment, supported by existing research.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** | medium | low | high | medium | You need a targeted approach to modify specific brain functions related to addiction. |

## Approaches

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

**Best for:** When developing interventions for opioid addiction or researching brain stimulation techniques.

**Tradeoff:** TMS is effective for targeted brain stimulation but may require specialized equipment and training.
