# Problem: Molecular Typing

Molecular typing involves classifying biological samples, such as tumors, based on their molecular characteristics. This classification is crucial for personalized medicine, allowing for tailored treatment strategies based on the specific genetic makeup of a patient's cancer.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with tumor samples.
- You need to classify tumors based on genetic data.
- You are involved in cancer research.
- You are analyzing large genomic datasets.
- You are looking for personalized treatment options.
