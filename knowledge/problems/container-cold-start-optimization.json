    "You experience significant delays when starting containers.",
    "Your application has strict latency requirements.",
    "You are deploying applications in a high-density VM environment.",
    "Resource utilization in your cloud infrastructure is suboptimal.",
    "You notice performance degradation during peak usage times."
