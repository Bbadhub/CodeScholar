# Problem: Control Optimization

Control optimization involves finding the best control actions to achieve desired outcomes in dynamic systems. This is particularly important in fields like chemical processing and smart home systems, where variables can change rapidly and unpredictably.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are managing a system with dynamic and stochastic variables.
- You need to optimize performance while adhering to safety constraints.
- You are looking to integrate user preferences into control systems.
- Your system requires adaptive solutions based on real-time data.
- You are facing challenges with limited prior knowledge about the system.
