  "problem_name": "Memory Leak Detection",
  "description": "Memory leak detection is the process of identifying areas in a program where memory is allocated but not properly released, leading to wasted resources and potential application crashes. This issue is particularly critical in languages like C and C++ where manual memory management is required.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "Your application is consuming more memory over time without releasing it.",
    "You experience performance degradation or crashes after prolonged use.",
    "You are using tools that report memory usage but do not pinpoint leaks.",
    "You have a large codebase with complex memory management.",
    "You are receiving reports of unexpected behavior related to memory."
