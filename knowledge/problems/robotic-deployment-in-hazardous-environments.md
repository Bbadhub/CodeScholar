# Problem: Robotic Deployment in Hazardous Environments

Deploying robots in hazardous environments involves navigating challenges such as high radiation levels, toxic substances, or unstable terrains. Effective solutions are needed to ensure safety and efficiency during operations.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with robots in environments with dangerous conditions.
- You need to ensure operator safety while controlling robotic systems.
- You are facing challenges in training operators for complex tasks.
- You require improved performance in teleoperated robotic systems.
- You are dealing with high-stress scenarios that require precise robotic operations.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is Haptic Digital Twins (HDT) and Assisted Operations (AO) due to its ability to enhance operator training and improve performance in hazardous settings.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Haptic Digital Twins (HDT) and Assisted Operations (AO)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to train operators effectively while ensuring safety in hazardous environments. |

## Approaches

### Haptic Digital Twins (HDT) and Assisted Operations (AO)

**Best for:** When deploying robots in environments with high radiation levels and training operators for complex tasks.

**Tradeoff:** This approach enhances operator training and task performance but may require significant setup time.
