  "description": "Distributed database consistency refers to the challenge of ensuring that all nodes in a distributed system reflect the same data state at any given time. This is crucial for applications that require strong consistency guarantees, especially in environments where data is frequently updated across multiple locations.",

    "You are experiencing data discrepancies across different nodes.",
    "Your application requires real-time data accuracy.",
    "You are facing challenges with transaction management in a distributed setup.",
