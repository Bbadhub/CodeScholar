  "problem_name": "Data Leakage Detection",
  "description": "Data leakage detection refers to the identification of situations where information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. This problem is crucial in machine learning as it can significantly impact the reliability of model predictions.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You notice discrepancies between training and validation performance.",
    "Your model performs significantly better on training data than on unseen data.",
    "You have limited annotated datasets for training models.",
    "You are concerned about the integrity of your machine learning pipeline.",
    "You want to ensure that your model generalizes well to new data."
