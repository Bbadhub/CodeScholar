# Problem: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis in Cooperative Game Theory

This problem involves making decisions that consider multiple criteria, often in scenarios where stakeholders have different preferences and objectives. It is particularly relevant in contexts like tourism development, where balancing economic benefits and stakeholder interests is crucial.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are trying to optimize decisions involving multiple conflicting criteria.

- You need to evaluate the impact of decisions on various locations or groups.
- You are working on strategies that require consensus among different parties.
- You are looking to implement policies that affect economic development.
