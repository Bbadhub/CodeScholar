# Problem: Integer Ambiguity Resolution

Integer ambiguity resolution is a challenge in positioning systems where the exact integer values of certain parameters need to be determined. This is particularly important in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to achieve high-precision positioning.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with GNSS data.
- You need to achieve a positioning success rate above 98%.
- You are facing high-dimensional optimization problems.
- You encounter ambiguities in integer values during data processing.
- You require a solution that balances speed and accuracy.

## Start Here

**Start with the Simulated Annealing Ant Lion Optimizer (SAALO) as it is specifically designed for high-precision integer ambiguity resolution in GNSS applications.**
