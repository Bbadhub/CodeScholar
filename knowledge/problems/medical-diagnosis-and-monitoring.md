# Problem: Medical Diagnosis and Monitoring

Medical diagnosis and monitoring involves identifying health conditions and tracking patient progress over time. This is crucial for timely interventions and effective treatment plans.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are monitoring patients with specific syndromes or conditions.
- You need to assess lung function in patients who cannot perform standard tests.
- You are looking for early detection methods for lung function deterioration.
- You require a non-invasive method for pulmonary assessment.
- You are dealing with patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) due to its non-invasive nature and applicability in specific patient populations.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT)** | medium | low | medium | medium | You need a non-invasive method to monitor lung function in patients who cannot perform standard tests. |

## Approaches

### Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT)

**Best for:** When monitoring patients with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome for pulmonary fibrosis and assessing lung function in patients unable to perform standard spirometry.

**Tradeoff:** FOT provides a non-invasive way to assess lung function but may not be as widely validated as traditional methods.
