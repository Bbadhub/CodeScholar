# Problem: Network Traffic Classification

Network traffic classification involves categorizing data packets based on their characteristics and behaviors. This is crucial for managing network resources, enhancing security, and optimizing performance in various environments.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing difficulties in identifying types of network traffic.
- Your current classification methods yield low accuracy.
- You need real-time classification for software-defined networking (SDN).
- You are looking for a solution that can adapt to evolving network patterns.
- You want to implement a rule-based classification system.

## Start Here

**Start with GenClass if you require a flexible and accurate classification method that leverages genetic programming, especially in dynamic SDN environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **GenClass** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a robust classification system that can evolve with network traffic patterns. |

## Approaches

### GenClass

**Best for:** when you need to classify network traffic in real-time for SDN environments and existing methods are inadequate.

**Tradeoff:** GenClass offers high adaptability through genetic programming but may require more computational resources.
