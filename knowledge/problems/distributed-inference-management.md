# Problem: Distributed Inference Management

Distributed inference management involves coordinating and optimizing the deployment of machine learning models across multiple locations or nodes. This ensures efficient resource utilization, secure access, and effective workload distribution for inference tasks.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are deploying machine learning models across different geographical locations.
- You need to manage multiple instances of models simultaneously.
- You require secure access to models without exposing sensitive information.
- You are facing challenges in balancing the workload among various resources.
- You need to optimize response times for inference requests.

## Start Here

**Start with Hive as it provides a comprehensive framework for managing distributed inference, especially when security and resource management are priorities.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Hive** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a reliable framework to manage distributed inference across multiple locations with secure access. |

## Approaches

### Hive

**Best for:** When you need to deploy multiple Ollama instances across different locations securely and efficiently.

**Tradeoff:** Hive provides a structured framework for distributed inference but may require initial setup and configuration.
