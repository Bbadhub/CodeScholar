# Problem: Event Streaming for High-Performance Computing

Event streaming in high-performance computing (HPC) involves the continuous flow of data generated by various sources that need to be processed in real-time. This problem is critical for applications that require immediate insights from large volumes of data, such as scientific simulations and real-time analytics.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with large volumes of data generated continuously.
- Your application requires real-time processing and low latency.
- You need to integrate multiple data sources efficiently.
- You are facing challenges with data transfer rates in your HPC environment.
- You require a scalable solution that can handle varying data loads.
