  "description": "Resource orchestration in serverless computing involves managing and optimizing the allocation of resources for serverless applications to ensure efficient performance and cost-effectiveness. This problem is particularly relevant in scenarios where latency, cold starts, and service level agreements (SLAs) are critical factors.",
