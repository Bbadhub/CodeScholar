# Problem: Traffic Simulation

Traffic simulation involves modeling the flow of vehicles in a given area to understand and predict traffic patterns. This is crucial for urban planning, system performance testing, and optimizing traffic management strategies.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing delays in traffic flow during peak hours.
- You need to evaluate the impact of new infrastructure on traffic.
- You want to test software that relies on accurate traffic data.
- You are preparing for an event that will significantly increase local traffic.
- You need to analyze the effects of traffic management strategies.
