# Problem: Action Recognition

Action recognition involves identifying and classifying actions or behaviors from video data. This is particularly important in fields like wildlife conservation, where understanding animal behavior can inform conservation efforts.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with video data.
- You need to classify actions or behaviors.
- You are dealing with complex scenarios involving multiple actions.
- You require high accuracy in your predictions.
- You are interested in applications related to wildlife or animal behavior.

## Start Here

**Start with the Mamba technique, as it is specifically designed for recognizing complex behaviors and has shown promising results in related studies.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
