# Problem: Soft Robotics Design and Muscle Mimicry

Soft robotics design focuses on creating robots that can mimic the flexibility and adaptability of biological organisms. Muscle mimicry involves replicating the dynamics of biological muscles to enhance the functionality of soft robots in various applications.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on a project that requires flexible manipulation.
- You need to study the dynamics of muscle movements in robotics.
- You are interested in creating devices that mimic biological systems.
- You are facing challenges with traditional rigid robotic designs.
- You are exploring new materials and structures for robotic applications.
