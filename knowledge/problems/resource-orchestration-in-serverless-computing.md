# Problem: Resource Orchestration in Serverless Computing

Resource orchestration in serverless computing involves managing and optimizing the allocation of resources for serverless applications to ensure efficient performance and cost-effectiveness. This problem is particularly relevant in scenarios where latency, cold starts, and service level agreements (SLAs) are critical factors.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing high latency in your serverless functions.
- Your serverless application is frequently exceeding budget constraints.
- You notice performance degradation during peak usage times.
- You are struggling to maintain SLA compliance in your serverless deployments.

## Start Here

**Start with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as it provides a structured approach to optimize resource orchestration in serverless computing while addressing common issues like latency and SLA compliance.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to balance resource usage and performance in a serverless environment with strict SLA requirements. |

## Approaches

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Best for:** when you need to optimize resource usage in a serverless application and address latency issues.

**Tradeoff:** While PPO can effectively optimize resource allocation, it may require significant computational resources for training.
