  "problem_name": "Concurrent Locking",
  "description": "Concurrent locking is a challenge in software engineering where multiple threads or processes need to access shared resources without causing data corruption or inconsistencies. It involves managing access to these resources in a way that ensures safety and efficiency, especially in high-contention scenarios.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are experiencing race conditions in your application.",
    "Your application has multiple threads accessing shared data.",
    "You notice performance bottlenecks due to locking.",
    "You require fairness in resource access among competing threads.",
    "Your application is designed to be highly concurrent."
