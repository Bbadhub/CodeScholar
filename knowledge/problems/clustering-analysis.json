  "description": "Clustering analysis is a technique used to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. This is often used in data analysis to identify patterns or structures within data sets.",

    "You have a dataset with multiple features.",
    "You want to identify natural groupings in your data.",
    "You are unsure of the number of clusters in advance.",
    "You need to visualize the relationships between data points.",
    "You are dealing with high-dimensional data."
