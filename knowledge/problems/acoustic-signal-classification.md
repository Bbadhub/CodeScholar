# Problem: Acoustic Signal Classification

Acoustic signal classification involves identifying and categorizing sounds based on their characteristics. This is particularly useful in applications such as wildlife monitoring, agricultural practices, and emotional analysis of animal vocalizations.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with audio data from animals or environments.
- You need to classify sounds into distinct categories.
- You are interested in non-invasive monitoring techniques.
- You require real-time analysis of acoustic signals.
- You are exploring AI applications in agriculture or animal welfare.

## Start Here

**Start with the Whisper technique as it provides a robust framework for non-invasive acoustic signal classification, particularly in agricultural settings.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Whisper** | medium | high | high | medium | You need to analyze animal vocalizations for emotional states in a real-time setting. |

## Approaches

### Whisper

**Best for:** When you need to monitor poultry welfare without invasive methods.

**Tradeoff:** This approach offers a balance between accuracy and non-invasiveness but may require significant computational resources.
