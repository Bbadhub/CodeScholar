# Problem: Empirical Statistical Downscaling

Empirical statistical downscaling involves using statistical methods to derive local climate information from larger-scale climate models. This technique is particularly useful in regions where direct climate observations are sparse or missing.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with missing climate data.
- You need localized climate projections.
- You are working in areas with limited observational data.
- You require climate variability analyses.
- You want to extend short-term forecasts with historical data.

## Start Here

**Start with RASCAL for reconstructing missing climate data, as it is specifically designed for this purpose and has been validated in relevant studies.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **RASCAL** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to fill gaps in climate data for specific regions with limited observations. |

## Approaches

### RASCAL (Reconstruction by AnalogS of ClimatologicAL time series)

**Best for:** when you need to reconstruct missing climate data in regions with limited observations.

**Tradeoff:** While RASCAL is effective for reconstruction, it may not perform well in areas with abundant observational data.
