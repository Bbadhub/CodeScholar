# Problem: System Modeling and Simulation

System modeling and simulation involves creating abstract models of complex systems to analyze their behavior under various conditions. This process helps engineers understand system dynamics, optimize performance, and predict outcomes before implementation.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to analyze the behavior of a complex system.
- You require real-time simulation capabilities.
- You are dealing with interconnected components.
- You need to represent implicit dependencies accurately.
- You are looking for a framework to facilitate system modeling.
