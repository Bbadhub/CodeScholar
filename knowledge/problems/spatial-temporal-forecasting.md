# Problem: Spatial-Temporal Forecasting

Spatial-temporal forecasting involves predicting future states of a system based on both spatial and temporal data. This is particularly relevant in fields like traffic management, where understanding patterns over time and across different locations is crucial.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to predict future values based on historical data.
- Your data has both spatial and temporal dimensions.
- You are working with complex datasets that vary over time and space.
- You require high accuracy in predictions for decision-making.
- You are facing challenges with traditional forecasting methods.

## Start Here

**Start with the Hierarchical Attention LSTM approach, as it is specifically designed to handle the complexities of spatial-temporal data and has shown promising results in traffic state prediction.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have complex spatial-temporal data and need to capture intricate patterns for accurate forecasting. |

## Approaches

### Hierarchical Attention LSTM (HierAttnLSTM)

**Best for:** when you need to predict traffic states across multiple corridors and capture both short-term and long-term traffic patterns.

**Tradeoff:** While it offers high accuracy, it may require significant computational resources.
