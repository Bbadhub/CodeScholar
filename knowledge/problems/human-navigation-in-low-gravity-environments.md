# Problem: Human Navigation in Low-Gravity Environments

Navigating in low-gravity environments, such as the Moon or Mars, presents unique challenges due to reduced gravitational forces affecting movement and orientation. This problem is critical for both robotic systems and human astronauts during exploration missions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on robotic systems for lunar exploration.
- You are developing training simulations for astronauts.
- You are creating assistive technologies for navigation in low-gravity environments.
- You encounter difficulties in simulating realistic movement in low-gravity conditions.
- You need to account for the effects of low gravity on navigation strategies.
