# Problem: Diagnostic Tool for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is a heart condition that can lead to abnormal heart rhythms. Diagnosing this condition can be challenging, especially when imaging results are inconclusive or when patients have a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

## You Have This Problem If

- Patients present with frequent PVCs.
- Imaging results are inconclusive.
- Previous catheter ablation procedures have not provided a clear diagnosis.
- There is a family history of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.
- Patients exhibit symptoms like palpitations or syncope.

## Start Here

**Start with Electroanatomic Mapping (EAM) as it provides detailed insights for diagnosing arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, especially in complex cases.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Electroanatomic Mapping (EAM)** | medium | medium | high | hard | You need a precise diagnosis for patients with inconclusive imaging and frequent PVCs. |

## Approaches

### Electroanatomic Mapping (EAM)

**Best for:** When diagnosing patients with frequent PVCs and inconclusive imaging results.

**Tradeoff:** EAM provides detailed mapping but may require specialized equipment and expertise.
