# Problem: Population-Level Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment

This problem involves evaluating how vulnerable different populations are to the impacts of climate change. It aims to identify which species or populations are at the greatest risk and to inform conservation strategies accordingly.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on conservation projects related to climate change.
- You need to assess the vulnerability of specific animal populations.
- You are developing strategies based on genetic data.
- You are seeking funding for at-risk species.
- You are involved in ecological research focused on climate impacts.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is to use the Life on the Edge framework, as it provides a structured method for assessing vulnerability and developing targeted conservation strategies.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Life on the Edge (LotE)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have access to genetic data and need to assess specific populations at risk due to climate change. |

## Approaches

### Life on the Edge (LotE)

**Best for:** When assessing the impact of climate change on specific animal populations and developing conservation strategies.

**Tradeoff:** While it provides a comprehensive framework, it may require extensive data collection and analysis.
