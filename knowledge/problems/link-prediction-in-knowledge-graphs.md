# Problem: Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs

Link prediction in knowledge graphs involves predicting the existence of relationships between entities based on their attributes and connections. This problem is crucial for enhancing the usability and accuracy of knowledge graphs, especially in domains like cybersecurity.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have a knowledge graph with entities and relationships.
- You notice missing links or relationships in your data.
- You are working with sparse and inconsistent data.
- You need to predict future relationships based on historical data.
- You want to improve the accuracy of your knowledge graph.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is Enhanced KGE with Spatio-Temporal Reasoning, as it effectively handles complex relationships and improves prediction accuracy in sparse datasets.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Enhanced KGE with Spatio-Temporal Reasoning** | medium | high | high | medium | You have complex data with spatio-temporal aspects and need to predict links accurately. |

## Approaches

### Enhanced KGE with Spatio-Temporal Reasoning

**Best for:** when you need to model complex cyber threats like APTs and improve accuracy in sparse data scenarios.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require more computational resources but offers better accuracy in complex scenarios.
