# Problem: Multi-UAV System Coordination

Multi-UAV system coordination involves managing and controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to work together effectively. The goal is to optimize their operations for tasks such as area coverage, surveillance, or search and rescue while ensuring efficiency and resilience.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are deploying multiple UAVs for a mission.
- You need to ensure that UAVs can adapt to failures.
- You are looking to minimize energy consumption during operations.
- You require coordination among UAVs for effective task execution.
- You are facing challenges in managing communication between UAVs.

## Start Here

**The Leader-Followers Paradigm is recommended as the first approach for most cases due to its balance of resilience and efficiency in multi-UAV operations.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Leader-Followers Paradigm** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a coordinated UAV operation that can adapt to dynamic environments and potential UAV failures. |

## Approaches

### Leader-Followers Paradigm

**Best for:** when you need to deploy multiple UAVs for area coverage quickly and efficiently.

**Tradeoff:** This approach provides resilience and energy optimization but may require more complex communication protocols.
