  "problem_name": "Data Amplification",
  "description": "Data amplification refers to the process of generating synthetic data to enhance existing datasets, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce. This is crucial in fields like particle physics and medical applications, where obtaining real data can be expensive or impractical.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You have a limited dataset that is insufficient for training models.",
    "You need to simulate scenarios that require more data points.",
    "You are facing challenges in data collection due to resource constraints.",
    "You want to maintain the integrity of the original data while expanding your dataset.",
    "You are working in a domain where data privacy is a concern, and synthetic data is preferred."
