# Problem: Global Optimization

Global optimization refers to the process of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions in a given problem space. This is particularly challenging due to the presence of multiple local optima that can mislead optimization algorithms.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are facing a complex problem with many variables.
- Your current optimization methods are yielding suboptimal results.
- You need to balance multiple objectives in your solution.
- You are working in fields like engineering design or operations research.
- You require a solution that adapts to changing problem parameters.
