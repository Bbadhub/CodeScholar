  "description": "Data imputation in longitudinal medical imaging involves filling in missing scans in a series of medical images taken over time. This is crucial for accurate disease progression predictions and treatment outcome simulations, especially in cases where complete data is not available.",

    "You have longitudinal MRI data with missing scans.",
    "You need to predict disease progression from incomplete data.",
    "You are developing models for treatment outcome simulations."
