  "description": "Nonlinear dynamics prediction involves forecasting the behavior of systems where outputs are not directly proportional to inputs, often leading to complex and unpredictable behavior. This is particularly relevant in fields like plasma physics, where understanding instabilities can significantly impact system performance.",
