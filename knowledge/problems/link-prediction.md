# Problem: Link Prediction

Link prediction is the task of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network. This is commonly used in social networks, recommendation systems, and various applications where relationships between entities are not fully known.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with incomplete graphs.
- You need to suggest potential connections in a social network.
- You are analyzing social network data for hidden relationships.
- You require accurate predictions for future connections.
- You are developing a recommendation system.

## Start Here

**Start with Common Neighbor Completion with Information Entropy (IECNC) as it provides a good balance of accuracy and implementation complexity for link prediction tasks.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Common Neighbor Completion with Information Entropy (IECNC)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to predict links in a social network with a focus on accuracy and hidden relationships. |

## Approaches

### Common Neighbor Completion with Information Entropy (IECNC)

**Best for:** When building recommendation systems that suggest potential connections in social networks.

**Tradeoff:** This approach balances accuracy with the complexity of implementation.
