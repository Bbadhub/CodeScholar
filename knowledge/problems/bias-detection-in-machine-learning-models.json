  "problem_name": "Bias Detection in Machine Learning Models",
  "description": "Bias detection in machine learning models involves identifying and mitigating unfair biases that may affect the performance and outcomes of AI systems. This is particularly crucial in sensitive applications such as healthcare, where biased models can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes for different groups.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "Your model's predictions vary significantly across different demographic groups.",
    "You are developing AI applications that impact decision-making in sensitive areas.",
    "You have observed unexpected behavior in your model's outputs.",
    "You are receiving feedback indicating potential bias from users or stakeholders.",
    "You are required to comply with regulations or ethical guidelines regarding fairness in AI."
