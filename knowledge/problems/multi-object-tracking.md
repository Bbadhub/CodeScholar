# Problem: Multi-Object Tracking

Multi-object tracking involves identifying and following multiple objects over time in a video or a sequence of images. This problem is particularly challenging in complex environments where objects may occlude each other or change appearance.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to track several objects simultaneously.
- Objects frequently overlap or occlude each other.
- You are working in a dynamic environment.
- You require real-time processing capabilities.
- You are implementing a solution for robotics or surveillance.

## Start Here

**Start with the MOT-DETR technique as it provides a balanced approach for tracking multiple objects in complex scenarios, especially when occlusions are present.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **MOT-DETR** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a robust solution for tracking multiple objects in environments with frequent occlusions. |

## Approaches

### MOT-DETR

**Best for:** When tracking multiple objects in complex environments with occlusions.

**Tradeoff:** Balances accuracy and complexity in a single-stage tracking solution.
