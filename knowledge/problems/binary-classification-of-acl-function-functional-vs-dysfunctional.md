# Problem: Binary Classification of ACL Function

This problem involves determining whether the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is functional or dysfunctional in patients, particularly those with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Accurate classification is crucial for guiding surgical decisions and improving patient outcomes.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are assessing patients with knee osteoarthritis.
- You need to make surgical decisions regarding ACL viability.
- You have access to radiographic images for analysis.
- You are looking for a predictive model to classify ACL function.
- You require a method that can be implemented preoperatively.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is the Radiographic prediction model, as it directly utilizes available X-ray images to assess ACL function, which is essential for preoperative decision-making.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Radiographic prediction model** | medium | low | medium | medium | You have radiographic images and need to classify ACL function for surgical planning. |

## Approaches

### Radiographic prediction model

**Best for:** When you need to assess ACL function in KOA patients preoperatively and guide surgical decisions.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may provide insights from X-ray images but may lack extensive validation.
