# Problem: Density-Based Clustering with Branch Detection

This problem involves identifying clusters in data that have varying densities and potential branching structures. It is particularly relevant in fields like biology and customer behavior modeling, where traditional clustering methods may overlook important subpopulations.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have data with complex structures that may include branches.
- Traditional clustering methods do not yield satisfactory results.
- You are dealing with datasets from biological studies or customer behavior.
- You observe that clusters in your data are not uniformly distributed.
- You need to identify subpopulations within a larger dataset.

## Start Here

**Start with FLASC as it is specifically designed for density-based clustering with branch detection, making it suitable for your needs.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **FLASC** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have a dataset with complex branching structures and need to identify distinct clusters. |

## Approaches

### FLASC

**Best for:** when you need to analyze data with potential branching structures and traditional methods fail.

**Tradeoff:** FLASC is effective for complex data but may require more computational resources.
