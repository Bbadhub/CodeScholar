# Problem: Graph Storage Optimization

Graph storage optimization involves improving the efficiency of storing and querying graph data structures. This is crucial for applications that require fast access to complex relationships and connections within large datasets.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing slow query performance on graph data.
- Your application requires real-time processing of graph queries.
- You have a high volume of read operations compared to write operations.
- Your current graph storage solution is consuming excessive memory.
- You are dealing with complex multi-hop queries that are difficult to optimize.
