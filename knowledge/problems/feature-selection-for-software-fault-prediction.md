# Problem: Feature Selection for Software Fault Prediction

Feature selection for software fault prediction involves identifying the most relevant features from a dataset to improve the accuracy of predicting software faults. This is crucial in software engineering as it helps in reducing complexity and enhancing model performance.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have a high-dimensional dataset with many features.
- Your current model is overfitting to the training data.
- You are seeking to improve the accuracy of your fault prediction models.
- You notice that some features may not contribute significantly to the prediction task.
- You are experiencing long training times due to the large number of features.
