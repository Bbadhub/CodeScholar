# Problem: Causal Inference

Causal inference is the process of determining whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between variables. It is essential for understanding the impact of interventions and making informed decisions based on data.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are trying to understand the impact of a specific change in your system.
- You need to identify potential causes of observed outcomes.
- You are working with complex data where relationships are not immediately clear.
- You want to make predictions based on causal relationships rather than mere correlations.

## Start Here

**Start with Causal Graph Extraction as it provides a structured way to visualize and analyze causal relationships, which is crucial for diagnosing issues and improving system reliability.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Causal Graph Extraction** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have complex data and need to understand causal relationships for effective decision-making. |

## Approaches

### Causal Graph Extraction

**Best for:** when you need to diagnose failures in complex distributed systems or improve reliability in critical systems.

**Tradeoff:** Provides clear causal relationships but may require significant data preparation.
