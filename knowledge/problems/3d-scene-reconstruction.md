# Problem: 3D Scene Reconstruction

3D scene reconstruction involves creating a three-dimensional representation of a scene from two-dimensional images. This process is essential for applications in virtual reality, gaming, and computer vision, where accurate spatial representations are required.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have a set of 2D images of a scene.
- You possess camera pose information for the images.
- You need to visualize complex 3D structures.
- You are interested in using machine learning techniques.
- You require high-quality renderings of the scene.

## Start Here

**Start with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) if you have the necessary data and resources, as it offers state-of-the-art results for 3D scene reconstruction.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have sufficient computational resources and need high-quality 3D scene representations. |

## Approaches

### Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

**Best for:** when you need to create high-quality visualizations of complex 3D scenes using neural networks.

**Tradeoff:** While NeRF provides high-quality outputs, it may require significant computational resources.
