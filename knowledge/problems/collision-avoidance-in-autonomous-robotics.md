# Problem: Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Robotics

Collision avoidance is a critical challenge in autonomous robotics, where robots must navigate and operate safely in dynamic environments. This involves detecting and responding to obstacles in real-time to prevent accidents and ensure smooth operation.

## You Have This Problem If

- Your robot frequently encounters unexpected obstacles.
- You are developing robots for environments with changing conditions.
- Your current collision avoidance system is not adapting well to new scenarios.
- You need to enhance the decision-making process of your robot based on user feedback.
- You are facing challenges in training your robot with diverse datasets.

## Start Here

**Start with Human-in-the-loop transfer learning as it allows for rapid adaptation to new environments and enhances decision-making through user feedback.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Human-in-the-loop transfer learning** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to quickly adapt your robot to new and unforeseen obstacles while incorporating user input. |

## Approaches

### Human-in-the-loop transfer learning

**Best for:** when developing autonomous robots that operate in dynamic environments and require rapid adaptation to new obstacles.

**Tradeoff:** This approach balances the need for adaptability with the complexity of integrating human feedback.
