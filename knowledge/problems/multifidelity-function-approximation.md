# Problem: Multifidelity Function Approximation

Multifidelity function approximation involves creating models that can leverage both high-fidelity and low-fidelity data to predict outcomes more accurately and efficiently. This is particularly useful in scenarios where high-fidelity data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have a limited amount of high-fidelity data.
- You possess a large dataset of low-fidelity data.
- You need to model complex functions.
- You are looking to reduce data collection costs.
- You require interpretable results from your models.

## Start Here

**Start with Multifidelity Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (MFKANs) as they effectively utilize low-fidelity data to enhance model accuracy while providing interpretable results.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Multifidelity Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (MFKANs)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to model complex functions with limited high-fidelity data and want to leverage abundant low-fidelity data. |

## Approaches

### Multifidelity Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (MFKANs)

**Best for:** When you have limited high-fidelity data but abundant low-fidelity data and need interpretable results.

**Tradeoff:** This approach balances the use of low-fidelity data to improve predictions while maintaining interpretability.
