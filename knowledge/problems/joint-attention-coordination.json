  "problem_name": "Joint Attention Coordination",
  "description": "Joint attention coordination refers to the ability of individuals to share focus on an object or event, which is crucial for effective communication and interaction. This problem is particularly relevant in robotics, where machines must interpret and respond to human social cues to engage effectively in collaborative tasks.",

    "You are developing a robot intended for social interaction.",
    "Your robot needs to understand and respond to human gestures.",
    "You are working on educational tools that require engagement with users.",
    "Your project involves assistive technologies for elderly individuals."
