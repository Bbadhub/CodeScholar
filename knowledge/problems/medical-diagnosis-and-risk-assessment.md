# Problem: Medical Diagnosis and Risk Assessment

Medical diagnosis and risk assessment involves evaluating a patient's health to identify potential diseases or conditions and assessing the risk of future health issues. This is crucial for timely intervention and effective treatment planning.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with patients who have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM).
- You need to assess arrhythmia risk without invasive procedures.
- You are looking to predict arrhythmogenic substrates.
- You are developing tools for cardiac health monitoring.
- You require statistical methods for accurate diagnosis.

## Start Here

**Start with Signal Averaged Electrocardiography (SAECG) as it provides a reliable non-invasive assessment for arrhythmia risk in NICM patients.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Signal Averaged Electrocardiography (SAECG)** | medium | low | high | medium | You need to evaluate arrhythmia risk in patients without invasive procedures. |

## Approaches

### Signal Averaged Electrocardiography (SAECG)

**Best for:** when you need a non-invasive method to assess arrhythmia risk in NICM patients.

**Tradeoff:** SAECG provides non-invasive assessment but may have limitations in specificity.
