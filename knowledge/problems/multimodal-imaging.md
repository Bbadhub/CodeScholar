# Problem: Multimodal Imaging

Multimodal imaging refers to the integration of multiple imaging techniques to obtain complementary information about a subject, often used in medical diagnostics. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of imaging by combining different modalities, such as PET, MRI, and CT, to provide a more comprehensive view of the biological processes.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on cancer detection and treatment.
- You need to improve the accuracy of existing imaging technologies.
- You are researching targeted therapies that require precise imaging.
- You are facing challenges with single-modality imaging limitations.
- You require detailed anatomical and functional information simultaneously.
