# Problem: Nanoparticle Characterization

Nanoparticle characterization involves the measurement and analysis of nanoparticles to understand their properties and behavior. This is crucial for applications in fields such as environmental science, materials science, and nanotechnology.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with micro- and nanoplastics in environmental samples.
- Existing spectroscopic techniques are not providing accurate measurements.
- You require high-resolution topographical data of nanoparticles.
- You need to analyze the surface properties of nanoparticles.
- You are facing challenges in distinguishing between different types of nanoparticles.

## Start Here

**Start with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for nanoparticle characterization, especially when other techniques fail to deliver the required resolution and accuracy.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need precise surface characterization of nanoparticles in complex samples. |

## Approaches

### Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

**Best for:** when high-resolution topographical data is essential and other techniques are inadequate.

**Tradeoff:** AFM provides detailed surface information but may have limitations in speed and sample size.
