# Problem: Multi-Robot Coordination

Multi-robot coordination involves managing and directing multiple robots to work together effectively to complete tasks. This problem is crucial in environments where robots must collaborate, share resources, and adapt to dynamic conditions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are developing a system with multiple autonomous robots.
- Your robots need to coordinate in real-time.
- Tasks must be shared among robots efficiently.
- Resource sharing is critical for the safety and efficiency of operations.
- The environment in which the robots operate is dynamic and unpredictable.

## Start Here

**Start with Petri nets if you need a formal approach to model the coordination of multiple robots, especially in environments where real-time interaction is necessary.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Petri nets** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a formal method to model and analyze the interactions between multiple robots in a dynamic environment. |

## Approaches

### Petri nets

**Best for:** When developing multi-robot systems that require real-time coordination and task sharing.

**Tradeoff:** Petri nets provide a structured way to model complex interactions but may require significant upfront design effort.
