# Problem: Non-Invasive Deep Brain Stimulation

Non-invasive deep brain stimulation involves techniques that stimulate brain regions without the need for surgical intervention. This approach aims to modulate brain activity to treat neurological disorders and enhance brain function.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are exploring treatments for neurological conditions.
- You require a method to influence deep brain structures without surgery.
- You are conducting research on brain function modulation.
- You are interested in the effects of neuromodulation on behavior.
- You have access to advanced imaging technologies for targeting.

## Start Here

**Start with Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) as it provides a non-invasive option for targeting deep brain structures effectively.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS)** | medium | low | medium | medium | You need a non-invasive method to stimulate deep brain areas for research or therapeutic purposes. |

## Approaches

### Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS)

**Best for:** when you need to target deep brain structures non-invasively and study neuromodulation effects.

**Tradeoff:** While TUS is non-invasive, it may have limitations in precision compared to invasive methods.
