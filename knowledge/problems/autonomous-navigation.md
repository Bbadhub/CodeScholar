# Problem: Autonomous Navigation

Autonomous navigation involves the ability of a vehicle or robot to navigate and make decisions in an environment without human intervention. This problem encompasses various challenges, including path planning, obstacle avoidance, and real-time decision-making.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are developing an autonomous vehicle.
- You need to simulate driving algorithms.
- You are focused on improving safety features in navigation systems.
- You require human-like decision-making capabilities in your system.
- You are dealing with dynamic environments that require real-time adjustments.

## Start Here

**Start with Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation, as it allows for adaptive learning and decision-making in dynamic environments, which is crucial for autonomous systems.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation** | medium | high | high | medium | You need a system that learns from interactions in a complex environment. |

## Approaches

### Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation

**Best for:** When developing autonomous vehicles that require human-like decision-making.

**Tradeoff:** This approach can provide high adaptability but may require extensive training data and computational resources.
