# Problem: Task Scheduling

Task scheduling involves allocating resources to tasks over time to optimize performance metrics such as latency, cost, and efficiency. It is particularly important in environments with varying resource capabilities and dynamic conditions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing delays in task completion.
- Resource utilization is suboptimal.
- You have multiple tasks with different priority levels.
- Your system is under heavy load and struggling to meet deadlines.
- You need to coordinate tasks in a collaborative environment.

## Start Here

**Start with Min-CCV and Min-V if your primary concern is optimizing for latency and cost in IoT applications, as it provides a balanced approach for heterogeneous environments.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Min-CCV and Min-V** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to optimize task scheduling in a heterogeneous computing environment. |
| **Knowledge-Based Planning** | medium | high | medium | hard | You are coordinating tasks in a collaborative setting with human interaction. |

## Approaches

### Min-CCV and Min-V

**Best for:** when optimizing task scheduling for IoT applications with strict latency requirements.

**Tradeoff:** This approach prioritizes cost efficiency but may require more complex implementation.

### Knowledge-Based Planning

**Best for:** when tasks require real-time adjustments based on human actions in dynamic environments.

**Tradeoff:** This technique enhances robot efficiency but may be less effective in static settings.
