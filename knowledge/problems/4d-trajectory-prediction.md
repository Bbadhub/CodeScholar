# Problem: 4D Trajectory Prediction

4D trajectory prediction involves forecasting the future positions of moving objects in a three-dimensional space over time, incorporating factors such as speed and direction. This is particularly critical in fields like air traffic management where accurate predictions can enhance safety and efficiency.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on real-time tracking of moving objects.
- You need to manage multiple trajectories simultaneously.
- You require high accuracy in predictions to avoid collisions.
- You are constrained by computational resources.
- You are dealing with dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

## Start Here

**Start with the RCBAM–TCN–LSTM technique as it is specifically designed for real-time trajectory prediction while being computationally efficient.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **RCBAM–TCN–LSTM** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a lightweight model that can run on standard CPUs or embedded devices while maintaining high prediction accuracy. |

## Approaches

### RCBAM–TCN–LSTM

**Best for:** When you need to predict aircraft trajectories in real-time for air traffic management.
