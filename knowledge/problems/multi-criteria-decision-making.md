# Problem: Multi-Criteria Decision-Making

Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) involves evaluating and prioritizing different options based on multiple conflicting criteria. It is commonly used in various fields where decisions must be made under uncertainty and subjective evaluations.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have multiple options to evaluate.
- The criteria for evaluation are not strictly quantitative.
- You need to incorporate expert opinions or subjective judgments.
- The decision-making process involves uncertainty.
- You are facing conflicting criteria that need to be balanced.

## Start Here

**Start with the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) if you need to incorporate subjective evaluations and handle uncertainty in your decision-making process.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to evaluate options with subjective criteria and uncertainty. |

## Approaches

### Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with Triangular q-rung Fuzzy Numbers (TR-q-ROFNS)

**Best for:** When you need to evaluate options with subjective criteria and incorporate uncertainty.

**Tradeoff:** This approach balances the complexity of fuzzy logic with the need for structured decision-making.
