# Problem: Multi-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem

The multi-dimensional bin packing problem involves efficiently packing items of various sizes into a finite number of bins while minimizing wasted space. This problem is common in logistics, resource allocation, and network optimization scenarios.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are trying to allocate resources in a way that minimizes waste.
- You have multiple constraints on item sizes and bin capacities.
- You are working with high-dimensional data.
- You need to optimize the arrangement of items in a limited space.
- You are facing challenges in efficiently managing distributed resources.

## Start Here

**Start with the Adaptive Boundary Whale Optimization Algorithm (ABWOA) as it is specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization and can effectively handle the complexities of multi-dimensional bin packing.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Adaptive Boundary Whale Optimization Algorithm (ABWOA)** | medium | high | high | medium | You are dealing with complex, high-dimensional optimization problems that require efficient resource allocation. |

## Approaches

### Adaptive Boundary Whale Optimization Algorithm (ABWOA)

**Best for:** when you need to optimize the mapping of physical networks to digital infrastructures or tackle high-dimensional optimization problems.

**Tradeoff:** While ABWOA can provide efficient solutions, it may require significant computational resources for very large datasets.
