# Problem: Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person from a digital image or video frame. It is widely used in security, user authentication, and surveillance applications.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to identify individuals in images or videos.
- You are developing a security system that requires user verification.
- You want to implement real-time monitoring features.
- You are working on a mobile application that requires user authentication.
- You have a dataset of facial images for training a model.

## Start Here

**Start with GSO-CNN as it is specifically designed for facial recognition tasks and has shown promising results in relevant applications.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **GSO-CNN** | medium | high | high | medium | You need a robust facial recognition system with high accuracy for security or authentication. |

## Approaches

### GSO-CNN

**Best for:** Building a facial recognition system for security applications and real-time user authentication.

**Tradeoff:** While GSO-CNN provides high accuracy, it may require significant computational resources.
