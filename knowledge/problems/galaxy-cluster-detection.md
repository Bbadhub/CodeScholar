# Problem: Galaxy Cluster Detection

Galaxy cluster detection involves identifying and cataloging groups of galaxies that are bound together by gravity. This is crucial for understanding the large-scale structure of the universe and the distribution of dark matter.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are analyzing large astronomical datasets.
- You need to identify clusters of galaxies in optical surveys.
- You are working with data from large-scale astronomical surveys.
- You require high accuracy in your detection methods.
- You are facing challenges with existing detection techniques.

## Start Here

**Start with COSMIC as it is specifically designed for galaxy cluster detection and offers improved accuracy for large datasets.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **COSMIC** | medium | high | high | medium | You have access to large datasets and need precise detection of galaxy clusters. |

## Approaches

### COSMIC

**Best for:** when you need to catalog galaxy clusters from large astronomical datasets with improved accuracy.

**Tradeoff:** COSMIC provides high accuracy but may require significant computational resources.
