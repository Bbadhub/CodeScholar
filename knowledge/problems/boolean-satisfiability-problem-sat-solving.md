# Problem: Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) Solving

The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) involves determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. It is a fundamental problem in computer science with applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence, verification, and optimization.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with complex logical expressions.
- You need to determine the satisfiability of a formula.
- You are facing performance issues with existing SAT solvers.
- You have large datasets that require efficient processing.
- You are exploring optimization techniques for problem-solving.

## Start Here

**Start with Multi-step Partitioning with SOM Clustering if you are dealing with large SAT problems and existing solvers are not meeting your performance needs, as it can provide a structured approach to improve efficiency.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
