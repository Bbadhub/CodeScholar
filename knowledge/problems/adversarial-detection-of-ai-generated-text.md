# Problem: Adversarial Detection of AI-Generated Text

This problem involves identifying text that has been generated by artificial intelligence, which can be challenging due to the sophisticated nature of AI-generated content. The goal is to develop reliable detection systems that can differentiate between human-written and AI-generated text, particularly in contexts like education and academic integrity.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are noticing an increase in AI-generated submissions in educational settings.
- There are concerns about academic integrity and the authenticity of student work.
- You need to implement policies regarding the use of AI tools in assessments.
- You are tasked with developing a tool to assist educators in identifying AI-generated content.
- You are facing challenges in distinguishing between human and AI writing styles.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is to implement adversarial techniques for GenAI text detectors, as they provide a strong foundation for accurately identifying AI-generated content in educational contexts.**
