  "problem_name": "Fuzzy Linear Programming",
  "description": "Fuzzy linear programming is a mathematical approach used to solve optimization problems where some parameters are uncertain or imprecise. It allows decision-makers to incorporate fuzzy logic into their models, making it suitable for real-world scenarios where data is not always exact.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are dealing with uncertain or imprecise data.",
    "Your decision-making process involves multiple conflicting objectives.",
    "You require solutions that are robust against variations in input parameters.",
    "You need to optimize resource allocation under uncertainty.",
    "You are working in fields like production planning or supply chain management."
