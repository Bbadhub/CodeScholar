  "problem_name": "Named Entity Recognition for De-identification",
  "description": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) for de-identification involves identifying and redacting sensitive information, such as names, from text data. This is particularly important in fields like healthcare, where patient privacy must be maintained while still allowing for data analysis.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are working with clinical narratives that contain sensitive information.",
    "You need to comply with regulations regarding patient data privacy.",
    "You want to analyze text data without exposing personally identifiable information.",
    "You are dealing with unstructured text that requires entity recognition.",
    "You have a need to maintain the context of the text while anonymizing it."

    {
      "technique": "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)",
