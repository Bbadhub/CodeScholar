# Problem: Multi-Criteria Recommendation Systems

Multi-criteria recommendation systems aim to suggest items to users based on various preferences and criteria. This problem is particularly challenging due to the need to balance multiple factors and often sparse data from user interactions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have users with diverse preferences.
- You are working with a dataset that has many missing values.
- You want to enhance the personalization of recommendations.
- You are facing challenges with traditional recommendation algorithms.
- You need to evaluate recommendations based on multiple criteria.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is to implement the VAE-MCRS technique, as it effectively handles multiple criteria and sparse data, leading to improved recommendation accuracy.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Criteria Recommendation Systems (VAE-MCRS)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have a rich dataset with multiple user preferences and need to improve recommendation accuracy. |

## Approaches

### Variational Autoencoder for Multi-Criteria Recommendation Systems (VAE-MCRS)

**Best for:** when you need to recommend items based on multiple user preferences and improve accuracy in sparse datasets.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require more computational resources compared to simpler models.
