# Problem: Federated Learning for Medical Data Sharing

Federated learning allows multiple healthcare providers to collaboratively train machine learning models on medical data without sharing the actual data itself. This approach is crucial for maintaining patient privacy while still benefiting from the collective knowledge of diverse datasets.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to comply with strict data privacy regulations.
- You are facing challenges in sharing sensitive medical data.
- You want to leverage data from multiple sources without centralizing it.
- You are working with limited computational resources.
- You require a solution that can adapt to heterogeneous data environments.

## Start Here

**Start with Heterogeneous Federated Learning with SM9 Threshold Identity Authentication, as it provides a robust framework for secure medical data sharing while addressing privacy concerns.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Heterogeneous Federated Learning with SM9 Threshold Identity Authentication** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need a secure and privacy-preserving method for training models on distributed medical data. |

## Approaches

### Heterogeneous Federated Learning with SM9 Threshold Identity Authentication
