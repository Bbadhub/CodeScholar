# Problem: Predictive Modeling for Financial Time Series Forecasting

This problem involves using historical financial data to predict future market trends, such as stock prices. It is crucial for developing trading strategies and making informed investment decisions.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- You want to implement a trading strategy that adapts to market conditions.
- You are dealing with high-frequency trading data.

## Start Here

**Start with RNNs or LSTMs for their ability to handle sequential data effectively, especially if you have a moderate amount of historical data.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, Autoencoders, GNNs, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning hybrids** | medium | high | high | medium | You have a large dataset and need to capture complex patterns in time series data. |

## Approaches

### RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, Autoencoders, GNNs, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning hybrids

**Best for:** When you need to model complex temporal dependencies in financial data.

**Tradeoff:** While powerful, these models can be computationally intensive and require large datasets.
