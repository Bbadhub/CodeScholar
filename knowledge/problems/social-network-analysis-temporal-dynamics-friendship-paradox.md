# Problem: Social Network Analysis with Temporal Dynamics and Friendship Paradox

This problem involves understanding how social connections and interactions evolve over time, particularly focusing on the friendship paradox, where individuals often have fewer friends than their friends do. This can lead to distorted perceptions of social norms and influence behavior within networks.

## You Have This Problem If

- You notice discrepancies between your social connections and those of your friends.
- You are analyzing communication patterns in a group setting.
- You are studying the impact of influential individuals in a network.
- You observe changes in social dynamics over time.
- You are interested in designing interventions to improve social perceptions.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is to use the Friendship Index, as it provides a clear framework for analyzing social dynamics and addressing the friendship paradox effectively.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Friendship Index** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to analyze social connections and their impact on perceptions in a structured manner. |

## Approaches

### Friendship Index

**Best for:** When designing social networks that aim to mitigate distorted perceptions of social norms.

**Tradeoff:** While effective for understanding social dynamics, it may oversimplify complex interactions.
