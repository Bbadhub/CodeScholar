  "problem_name": "Life-Cycle Assessment of Embodied Carbon Emissions",
  "description": "Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a method used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction to disposal. In the context of embodied carbon emissions, LCA helps in understanding the total greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure.",
