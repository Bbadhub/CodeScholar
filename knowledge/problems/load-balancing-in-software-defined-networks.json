    "You are experiencing uneven traffic distribution across network resources.",
    "Your network performance is degrading due to overloaded switches or links.",
    "You are implementing a software-defined network architecture.",
    "You need to scale your network dynamically based on traffic demands.",
    "You are looking to improve resource utilization and reduce latency."
