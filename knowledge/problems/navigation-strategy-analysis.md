# Problem: Navigation Strategy Analysis

Navigation strategy analysis involves evaluating how users interact with a system to find information or complete tasks. This can include understanding user behavior patterns and optimizing the navigation structure to enhance user experience.

## You Have This Problem If

- Users frequently struggle to find information within your application.
- There are high drop-off rates at certain navigation points.
- User feedback indicates confusion about how to navigate the system.
- Analytics show low engagement with certain features due to navigation issues.

## Start Here

**Start with DeepWalk if you are focused on understanding user navigation behavior in detail, as it can reveal hidden patterns in user interactions.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
