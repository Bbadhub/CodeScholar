This problem is crucial for tasks that require understanding and retrieving data from diverse sources without explicit annotations.",

    "You are working with unannotated datasets.",
    "You need to retrieve materials based on high-level properties.",
    "You want to visualize relationships between different types of data.",
    "You are leveraging existing literature for materials discovery.",
    "You are dealing with multiple modalities in your data."
