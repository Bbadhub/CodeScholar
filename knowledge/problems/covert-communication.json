  "description": "Covert communication involves transmitting information in a way that conceals the existence of the communication itself. This is particularly important in environments where surveillance is prevalent and where the detection of communication patterns could lead to censorship or interception.",
  "you_have_this_if": [
    "You are operating in a high-surveillance environment.",
    "You need to send sensitive information securely.",
    "You want to avoid detection by censors.",
    "You are working with IoT devices that require secure data exchange.",
    "You have experienced issues with traditional communication methods being monitored."
