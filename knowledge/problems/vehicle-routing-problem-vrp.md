# Problem: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) involves finding the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations. This problem is crucial in logistics and transportation, especially for minimizing costs and improving service levels.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are managing a fleet of delivery vehicles.
- You need to reduce transportation costs.
- You are facing challenges with timely deliveries.
- You have multiple delivery locations to manage.
- You are dealing with constraints like vehicle capacity or time windows.
