# Problem: Evapotranspiration Estimation

Evapotranspiration estimation involves calculating the amount of water that is transferred from the land to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. This is crucial for water resource management, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

## You Have This Problem If

- You need to estimate water use in agricultural or forestry settings.
- You are working with satellite data for environmental modeling.
- You have limited in situ data for your region.
- You require accurate predictions for water management.
- You are interested in machine learning approaches to improve estimation.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is to use the Ensemble Machine Learning Model (EMLM) due to its ability to integrate various data sources and improve accuracy, especially in regions with limited data.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Ensemble Machine Learning Model (EMLM)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have access to diverse datasets and need to improve prediction accuracy for evapotranspiration. |

## Approaches

### Ensemble Machine Learning Model (EMLM)

**Best for:** When you need to leverage multiple data sources and improve prediction accuracy.

**Tradeoff:** While EMLM can provide high accuracy, it may require significant computational resources.
