# Problem: Remaining Time Prediction

Remaining time prediction involves estimating how much time is left for a task or workflow to complete. This is particularly important in cloud-based applications where resource allocation and efficiency are critical.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with cloud-based workflows.
- You need to optimize resource allocation.
- You are evaluating different encoding techniques for event data.
- You are dealing with time-sensitive tasks.
- You require accurate predictions for task completion.
