# Problem: Distributed Data Processing

Distributed data processing involves managing and analyzing large datasets across multiple computing nodes. This approach is essential for handling data that exceeds the capacity of a single machine, ensuring scalability and efficiency in data analysis.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with large datasets that cannot fit into memory on a single machine.
- Your data processing tasks require significant computational resources.
- You need to scale your data processing capabilities as data volume increases.
- You are working in a collaborative environment where data is generated from multiple sources.
- You require fault tolerance and reliability in your data processing workflows.

## Start Here

**Start with Hadoop-based distributed data processing if you are facing challenges with large datasets and require a scalable solution. It is well-suited for environments with high data throughput requirements.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Hadoop-based distributed data processing** | medium | high | high | medium | You need to process large volumes of data across a distributed system with fault tolerance. |

## Approaches

### Hadoop-based distributed data processing

**Best for:** Handling large datasets from scientific experiments and needing scalable data processing solutions.

**Tradeoff:** While Hadoop provides scalability, it may introduce complexity in setup and management.
