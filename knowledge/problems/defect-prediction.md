# Problem: Defect Prediction

Defect prediction involves forecasting potential defects in software before they occur, allowing teams to proactively address issues. This is crucial for maintaining software quality and minimizing the risk of bugs in future releases.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are experiencing frequent bugs in your software releases.
- Your team is planning significant code changes or new features.
- You want to improve the reliability of your CI/CD pipeline.
- You have historical data on past defects and want to leverage it.
- You are under pressure to deliver high-quality software quickly.

## Start Here

**Start with Advanced Predictive Models, as they provide a robust framework for predicting defects based on historical data and can significantly improve your software quality assurance processes.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Advanced Predictive Models** | medium | high | high | medium | You have sufficient historical data and need to predict defects for complex code changes. |

## Approaches

### Advanced Predictive Models

**Best for:** when you need to assess the risk of defects in upcoming releases and enhance your CI pipeline with predictive analytics.

**Tradeoff:** While advanced models can provide accurate predictions, they may require significant data and computational resources.
