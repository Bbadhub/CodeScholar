# Problem: Image Enhancement

Image enhancement involves improving the visual quality of images to make them more suitable for analysis or viewing. This is particularly important in fields such as surveillance, medical imaging, and digital media where clarity and detail are crucial.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working with low-resolution images.
- Your application requires high-quality visuals for analysis.
- You notice that images lack detail and clarity.
- You are developing software for surveillance or medical purposes.
- You want to improve the overall aesthetic quality of digital images.

## Start Here

**Start with Various SISR architectures as they provide a robust solution for enhancing low-resolution images, especially in critical applications.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Various SISR architectures** | medium | high | high | medium | You need to enhance images for applications where detail is critical, such as medical imaging or surveillance. |

## Approaches

### Various SISR architectures

**Best for:** when you need to enhance low-resolution images for analysis or improve image quality in specific applications.

**Tradeoff:** While SISR architectures can significantly improve image quality, they may require substantial computational resources.
