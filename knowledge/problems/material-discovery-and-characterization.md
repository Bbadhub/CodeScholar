# Problem: Material Discovery and Characterization

Material discovery and characterization involves identifying and understanding new materials that can be used in various applications, particularly in advanced technologies like quantum computing and energy storage. This process requires a deep understanding of material properties and behaviors at different scales.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on developing new materials for specific applications.
- You need to understand the properties of materials at the nanoscale.
- You are exploring advanced materials for energy storage solutions.
- You are conducting research in the field of quantum computing.
- You require a comprehensive overview of existing materials and their characteristics.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach is to conduct a Quantum Materials Review, as it provides a solid foundation of knowledge and context for further material discovery efforts.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
