# Problem: Image Enhancement for QR Code Reconstruction

This problem involves improving the quality of QR code images to make them readable, especially when they are low-quality or poorly scanned. Effective enhancement techniques are crucial in commercial applications where reliable QR code scanning is essential.

## You Have This Problem If

- You have low-quality scans of QR codes that are difficult to read.
- You are facing issues with QR code scanning in poor lighting conditions.
- You need to ensure high reliability in QR code recognition for commercial use.
- You are working with images that have low contrast or are pixelated.
- You require a solution that can enhance QR codes for better scanning performance.

## Start Here

**Start with Enhanced Deep Super Resolution (EDSR) as it provides a good balance between quality enhancement and computational efficiency for QR code reconstruction.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Enhanced Deep Super Resolution (EDSR), Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Network (ESPCN), Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)** | medium | high | high | medium | You have access to sufficient computational resources and need to enhance QR codes for improved readability. |

## Approaches

### Enhanced Deep Super Resolution (EDSR), Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Network (ESPCN), Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)

**Best for:** When you need to recover unreadable QR codes from low-quality scans or enhance scanning in challenging environments.

**Tradeoff:** While these techniques can significantly improve image quality, they may require substantial computational resources.
