# Problem: Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering

This problem involves answering intricate questions that require accessing and reasoning over a large knowledge base. It often necessitates breaking down questions into smaller, manageable sub-questions to derive accurate answers.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are dealing with multi-part questions.
- Your knowledge base is extensive and complex.
- You need to improve the accuracy of your current question answering system.
- You encounter frequent logical dependencies in questions.
- You require a structured approach to answer generation.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is the Hereditary Attentive Template-based Approach, as it effectively handles the complexity of the questions and improves accuracy in responses.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Hereditary Attentive Template-based Approach** | medium | medium | high | medium | You have a complex question that can be logically decomposed into sub-questions. |

## Approaches

### Hereditary Attentive Template-based Approach

**Best for:** when you need to answer complex questions from a large knowledge base and improve accuracy.

**Tradeoff:** This approach may require more initial setup and understanding of templates but yields higher accuracy.
