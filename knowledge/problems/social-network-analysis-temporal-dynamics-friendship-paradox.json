  "description": "This problem involves understanding how social connections and interactions evolve over time, particularly focusing on the friendship paradox, where individuals often have fewer friends than their friends do. This can lead to distorted perceptions of social norms and influence behavior within networks.",

    "You notice discrepancies between your social connections and those of your friends.",
    "You are analyzing communication patterns in a group setting.",
    "You are studying the impact of influential individuals in a network.",
    "You observe changes in social dynamics over time.",
    "You are interested in designing interventions to improve social perceptions."
