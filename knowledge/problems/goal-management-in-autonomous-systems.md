# Problem: Goal Management in Autonomous Systems

Goal management in autonomous systems involves enabling machines to set, pursue, and adapt their objectives autonomously. This is crucial for applications that operate in dynamic environments where user needs and external conditions can change rapidly.

## You Have This Problem If

- Your system needs to make decisions without human intervention.
- The environment in which your system operates is unpredictable.
- You require your application to adapt to varying user requirements.
- Your project involves complex task management that requires prioritization and re-evaluation of goals.
