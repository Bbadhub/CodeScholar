# Problem: Scene Recognition

Scene recognition involves identifying and classifying different environments or settings from visual data. This is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, where understanding the surroundings is essential for decision-making.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are working on a project that involves visual data processing.
- Your application requires understanding complex environments.
- You face challenges with varying lighting conditions.
- You need to differentiate between similar visual features.
- You are developing systems that require real-time scene analysis.

## Start Here

**Start with Multimodal Scene Recognition as it provides a robust framework for understanding complex scenes, especially in autonomous navigation tasks.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
