    "You are designing an AR application that requires precise user interactions.",
    "You need to compare the performance of different head-mounted display (HMD) technologies.",
    "You are conducting user studies to evaluate the impact of visual technologies on task performance.",
    "You have observed inconsistent user performance across different interaction methods.",
    "You want to gather quantitative data on user experience and task completion times."
