# Problem: Software Supply Chain Integrity Verification

Software supply chain integrity verification involves ensuring that the software components used in a project are authentic and have not been tampered with. This is crucial for maintaining trust in software systems, especially in decentralized environments like open-source projects.

## You Have This Problem If

- You are using third-party libraries or components in your software.
- You are concerned about the security of your software supply chain.
- You are working in a collaborative environment with multiple contributors.
- You need to comply with regulatory requirements regarding software integrity.
- You have experienced issues with software integrity in the past.

## Start Here

**The recommended first approach for most cases is Distributed Software Build Assurance, as it provides a robust framework for verifying software integrity in decentralized projects.**

## Decision Matrix

| Technique | Speed | Memory | Accuracy | Ease | Best When |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Distributed Software Build Assurance** | medium | medium | high | medium | You need to ensure the authenticity of software builds in a collaborative and decentralized environment. |

## Approaches

### Distributed Software Build Assurance

**Best for:** when you need to verify the integrity of software builds in a decentralized manner.

**Tradeoff:** This approach provides strong integrity verification but may require more resources and coordination.
